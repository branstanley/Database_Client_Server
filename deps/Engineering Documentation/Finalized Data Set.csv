1	Broadband Sub-Wavelength Profile High-Gain Antennas Based on Multi-Layer Metasurfaces	Konstantinidis, K.; Feresidis, A.P.; Hall, P.S.	Antennas and Propagation, IEEE Transactions on	20141231	A method for designing sub-wavelength-profile and broadband high-gain planar antennas is presented. A novel multi-layer periodic array design is proposed for sub-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavity type antennas with enhanced bandwidth performance. Three double-sided periodic arrays are designed and optimized, each double-sided array consisting of a capacitive artificial impedance surface (AIS) and an inductive partially reflective surface (PRS) printed on either side of a dielectric substrate. They are placed at about sixth of a wavelength from a ground plane and from each other. Thus, three air cavities are created with a total profile of $lambda/2$ . The proposed antenna has been simulated using CST Microwave Studio and measured achieving 16.9 dBi directivity with 10.7% 3 dB bandwidth. The gain-bandwidth product of the proposed designs outperforms any previous Fabry-Perot antenna design with this profile.

2	Parallel Style-Aware Image Cloning for Artworks	Zhao, Y.; Jin, X.; Xu, Y.; Zhao, H.; Ai, M.; Zhou, K.	Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on	20141230	We present style-aware image cloning, a novel image editing approach for artworks, which allows users to seamlessly insert any photorealistic or artificial objects into an artwork to create a new image that shares the same artistic style with the original artwork. To this end, a real-time image transfer algorithm is developed to stylize the cloned object according to a distance metric based on the artistic styles and semantic information. Several interactive functions, such as layering, shadowing, semantic labeling, and direction field editing, are provided to enhance the harmonization of the composite image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

3	Improved thermal stability and electrical properties of atomic layer deposited HfO2/AlN high-k gate dielectric stacks on GaAs	Cao, Yan-Qiang; Li, Xin; Zhu, Lin; Cao, Zheng-Yi; Wu, Di; Li, Ai-Dong	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films	20141211	The thermal stability and electrical properties of atomic layer deposited HfO2/AlN high-k gate dielectric stacks on GaAs were investigated. Compared to HfO2/Al2O3 gate dielectric, significant improvements in interfacial quality as well as electrical characteristics after postdeposition annealing are confirmed by constructing HfO2/AlN dielectric stacks. The chemical states were carefully explored by the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicates the AlN layers effectively prevent from the formation of defective native oxides at elevated temperatures. In addition, it is found that NH3 plasma during AlN plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition also has the self-cleaning effect as Al(CH3)3 in removing native oxides. The passivating AlN layers suppress the formation of interfacial oxide and trap charge, leading to the decrease of capacitance equivalent thickness after annealing. Moreover, HfO2/AlN/GaAs sample has a much lower leakage current density of 2.23 � 10?4 A/cm2 than HfO2/Al2O3/GaAs sample of 2.58 � 10?2 A/cm2. For the HfO2/AlN/GaAs sample annealed at 500 �C, it has a lowest interface trap density value of 2.11 � 1011 eV?1 cm?2. These results indicate that adopting HfO2/AlN dielectric stacks may be a promising approach for the realization of high quality GaAs-based transistor devices.								
4	Impact of buffer sizing on energy efficiency and performance	Ai, T.; Wijeratne, V.; Wahid, A.A.	Networks, IET	20141222	Internet router buffers are commonly made very large with the aim of minimising losses and maximising link utilisation, supported by the ever-decreasing cost of memory. However, large packet queues not only increase the energy consumption, but can also adversely affect network performance which has recently been attracting attention under ﾑbufferbloatﾒ. This study compares the buffer-related energy consumption of two models, that is, ﾑlarge-buffer with onﾖoff serverﾒ and ﾑsmall-buffer with always-on serverﾒ in the presence of multiplexed onﾖoff traffic and FTP traffic; and demonstrates that the latter model is more energy efficient. Further analysis is then carried out on the ﾑsmall-buffer model with always-on serverﾒ for the evaluation of its performance against different levels of energy consumption. Relationships among energy, delay, throughput and loss are studied in a range of scenarios, quantifying the variations in performance metrics in relation to energy consumption. In general, lower buffer sizes which reduce the energy consumption were found to improve delay, but sacrifice throughput by 5ﾖ8% at high load. Based on a broad set of results, this study provides guidelines for sizing router buffers in realistic networks which would lead to optimal trade-offs between energy consumption and quality of service.

6	Optimizing Template for Lookup-Table Inverse Halftoning using Elitist Genetic Algorithm	Zhi-Qiang Wen; Yong-Le Lu; Zhi-Gao Zeng; Wen-Qiu Zhu; Jun-Hua Ai	Signal Processing Letters, IEEE	20140821	A template optimization method based on elitist genetic algorithm was proposed for lookup-table inverse halftoning. A mathematical model with constraint conditions was built to describe the template optimization problem. We solved this optimization problem by using elitist genetic algorithm and designed the details about encoding and decoding scheme, selection and reproduce, crossover, mutation, elitist strategy and fitness function according to the proposed optimization model. In experiments, we demonstrated the performance on Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion, Jarvis-Judice error diffusion, cluster dither, Bayer disperse dither and dot diffusion halftone images. According to our experiment study, our method approaches to the optimal result closer than the greedy algorithm and simulated annealing do. We suggested L = 10 on cluster dither images but L = 5 on other four kinds of halftone images.

7	An Integrated System for Regional Environmental Monitoring and Management Based on Internet of Things	Shifeng Fang; Li Da Xu; Yunqiang Zhu; Jiaerheng Ahati; Huan Pei; Jianwu Yan; Zhihui Liu	Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on	20140502	Climate change and environmental monitoring and management have received much attention recently, and an integrated information system (IIS) is considered highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and Web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisi- e factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved. This paper provides a prototype IIS for environmental monitoring and management, and it also provides a new paradigm for the future research and practice; especially in the era of big data and IoT.

8	Study of stacked-emitter layer for high efficiency amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells	Lee, Youngseok; Kim, Heewon; Iftiquar, S.M.; Kim, Sunbo; Kim, Sangho; Ahn, Shihyun; Lee, Youn-Jung; Dao, Vinh Ai; Yi, Junsin	Journal of Applied Physics	20150105	A modified emitter, of stacked two layer structure, was investigated for high-efficiency amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (HJ) solar cells. Surface area of the cells was 181.5 cm2. The emitter was designed to achieve a high open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). When doping of the emitter layer was increased, it was observed that the silicon dihydride related structural defects within the films increased, and the Voc of the HJ cell decreased. On the other hand, while the doping concentration of the emitter was reduced the FF of the cell reduced. Therefore, a combination of a high conductivity and low defects of a single emitter layer appears difficult to obtain, yet becomes necessary to improve the cell performance. So, we investigated a stacked-emitter with low-doped/high-doped double layer structure. A low-doped emitter with reduced defect density was deposited over the intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon passivation layer, while the high-doped emitter with high conductivity was deposited over the low-doped emitter. The effects of doping and defect density of the emitter, on the device performance, were elucidated by using computer simulation and an optimized device structure was formulated. The simulation was performed with the help of Automat for the Simulation of Heterostructures simulation software. Finally, based on the simulation results, amorphous/crystalline heterojunction silicon solar cells were optimized by reducing density of defect states in the stacked-emitter structure and we obtained 725 mV, 77.41%, and 19.0% as the open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and photo-voltaic conversion efficiency of the device, respectively.

10	Observation of Three Bound States From a Topological Insulator Mode-Locked Soliton Fiber Laser	Ai-Ping Luo; Hao Liu; Nian Zhao; Xu-Wu Zheng; Meng Liu; Rui Tang; Zhi-Chao Luo; Wen-Cheng Xu	Photonics Journal, IEEE	20140819	We report on the generation of three types of bound states in a topological insulator-based mode-locked fiber laser. Benefiting from the excellent performance of the polyvinyl alcohol-based topological insulator saturable absorber (SA), we have achieved three types of bound solitons. The bound states exhibit different features both in spectra and autocorrelation traces, which was found to be caused by the different peak intensities and pulsewidths of two closed pulses within the bound states. The experimental phenomena were further confirmed by the numerical simulations. The results reveal an alternative method to roughly estimate the constructed solitons within bound states and indicate that the topological insulator could serve as a highly nonlinear SA for observing soliton dynamics in fiber lasers.

12	A Fast Hybrid Method for EM Analysis of Electrically Large Metal Space Frame Radomes	Yuyuan An; Rushan Chen	Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters, IEEE	20140620	This letter proposes a fast hybrid method that combines the physical optics (PO) method and aperture integration-surface integration (AI-SI) method for electromagnetic (EM) radiation analysis of electrically large metal space fame radomes. First, the magnetic or/and electric fields on the surface of the metal space frame and inner surface of the dielectric radome are calculated by the Stratton-Chu equation. Second, the scattering fields from the metal space frame are calculated by the PO method, and the transmitted fields on the outer surface of the dielectric radome are determined by the transmission coefficient calculated by the network theory. To accelerate the implementation of the procedure, an efficient parallelization scheme is adopted, and the Lagrange interpolation is used to calculate the transmission coefficients. Numerical results demonstrate that there is a good agreement between the proposed method and the numerical method, and the computation can be accelerated by 3.9 times with interpolation.

13	An Automatically Generated Evaluation Function in General Game Playing	Waledzik, K.; Mandziuk, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140911	General game-playing (GGP) competitions provide a framework for building multigame-playing agents. In this paper, we describe an attempt at the implementation of such an agent. It relies heavily on our knowledge-free method of automatic construction of an approximate state evaluation function, based on game rules only. This function is then employed by one of the two game tree search methods: MTD (f) or guided upper confidence bounds applied to trees (GUCT), the latter being our proposal of an algorithm combining UCT with the usage of an evaluation function. The performance of our agent is very satisfactory when compared to a baseline UCT implementation.

Its dynamic evolution has been investigated through the electrical measurements and highspeed imaging, which shows that the arc is formed after several breakdowns of the gas and then glides stably with a low-discharge current. The intensity of the light emitting from the arc root at the cathode is remarkably higher than that at other areas during the arc gliding.

15	Security and Reliability Performance Analysis for Cloud Radio Access Networks With Channel Estimation Errors	Jia You; Zhangdui Zhong; Gongpu Wang; Bo Ai	Access, IEEE	20141126	Physical layer (PHY) security is recently regarded as a promising technique to improve the security performance of wireless communication networks. Current developments in PHY security are often based on the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, both security and reliability performance for the downlink cloud radio access network with optimal remote radio heads (RRHs) node selection are investigated in a practical scenario by considering channel estimation (CE) errors. In particular, a three-phase transmission scheme is proposed and the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation method is utilized to obtain the CSI. Based on the CSI estimates and the statistics of CE errors, the outage probability and intercept probability are derived in closed-form expression to evaluate the security and reliability performance, respectively. In addition, two possible cases (with or without intercepting signals from baseband unit) are considered for the eavesdropper. It is found that the suggested optimal RRHs selection scheme outperforms the nonselection scheme, and that the increasing number of RRHs can lower the outage probability as well as the intercept probability. It is also shown that there exists an optimal training number to minimize the sum of the outage probability and intercept probability. Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate our proposed studies.

16	Consensus of a leader-following multi-agent system with negative weights and noises	Ai-Hua Hu; Jin-De Cao; Man-Feng Hu; Liu-Xiao Guo	Control Theory & Applications, IET	20140102	This study is concerned with the issue of mean-square consensus for a model of leader-following multi-agent system. The agents acting as followers update states based on the information received from the time varying neighbours and the virtual leader. Negative weights besides positive weights are introduced for the links existing among the agents. Moreover, all followers considered here are influenced by noises with different intensities emerging from the external environment or transmission channels. In order to guarantee consensus of the multi-agent system under the noises, the corresponding sufficient conditions are derived. Theoretical proofs are given mainly by using the Lyapunov function approach and the stochastic analysis. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results.

It is reported that the thermal conductivity of perfect graphene nanoribbons decreases with the gaseous pressure. The decreasing is more obvious for the noble gas with large atomic number. However, the gaseous pressure cannot change the thermal conductivity of defective graphene nanoribbons apparently. The phonon spectra of graphene nanoribbons are also provided to give corresponding supports.

The modal interferometer is composed of a coaxial fiber, which is sandwiched in between two single mode fibers with small lateral core-offsets. Such a modal interferometer is insensitive to external refractive index (RI) and can work when the surrounding RI is larger than the RI of the fiber cladding. It has high temperature sensitivity of 78 pm/ﾰC and low cross-sensitivity to strain of 0.004 ﾰC/??.

20	Multifunctional Optical Filter Using Direct-Coupled and Cross-Coupled All-Pass Filters	Dingel, B.	Photonics Technology Letters, IEEE	20140320	We present a multifunction optical filter that operate as: 1) symmetric interleaver (SI); 2) asymmetric interleaver (AI); 3) dual-wavelength, channel passing add-drop filter (ADF); and 4) dual-wavelength, channel dropping ADF. The new filter is a pair of direct-coupled all-pass-filter (APF) and cross-coupled APF positioned in each of the two arms of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Depending on the MZI's path length difference and the values of the coupler's coefficients, these four functions are demonstrated. The interleaver has a superior flat-top profile, low ripple value ( -0.095 dB for SI, -0.075 dB for AI), and high extinction ratio . The effect on waveguide losses on flat-top, ripple, slope, and SNR are also investigated.

The system is based on multiobjective optimization algorithms providing solutions that are on the so-called Pareto optimal front. The solutions are a trade-off among different objectives, including surveillance risk, area coverage, and mission costs. In general, the inclusion of an objective in the multiobjective vector function is application dependent.	,International relations;Marine vehicles;Piracy;Satellites;Sensors;Surveillance,marine engineering;optimisationPareto optimal front;area coverage;counter piracy operation support;improved maritime traffic situational awareness;mission costs;multiobjective optimization algorithms;optimal asset network planning;resource allocation;satellite AIS coverage;surveillance risk							
22	Electrical characterization of H2S adsorption on hexagonal WO3 nanowire at room temperature	Liu, Binquan; Tang, Dongsheng; Zhou, Yong; Yin, Yanling; Peng, Yuehua; Zhou, Weichang; Qin, Zhu'ai; Zhang, Yong	Journal of Applied Physics	20141030	We have characterized the electrical transport properties of Au/WO3 nanowire/Au devices in ambient air and gaseous H2S to investigate the adsorption kinetics of H2S molecules on the surface of WO3 nanowire at room temperature. The WO3 nanowire devices exhibit increasing linear conductance and electrical hysteresis in H2S. Furthermore, the contact type between Au electrode and WO3 nanowire can be converted from original ohmic/Schottky to Schottky/ohmic after being exposed to H2S. These results suggest that adsorbed H2S molecules are oxidized by holes to form hydrogen ions and S atoms, which will result in formation of hydrogen tungsten bronze and desorption of previously chemically adsorbed H2O molecules. Adsorbed H2S molecules can also oxidize previously adsorbed and ionized oxygen, which will release the electrons from the ionized oxygen and then weaken upward band bending at the surface of WO3 nanowire.								
23	Enhanced spin polarization in graphene with spin energy gap induced by spin-orbit coupling and strain	Liu, Zheng-Fang; Wu, Qing-Ping; Chen, Ai-Xi; Xiao, Xian-Bo; Liu, Nian-Hua	Journal of Applied Physics	20140602	We investigate the possibility of spin polarization in graphene. The result shows that a spin energy gap can be opened in the presence of both spin-orbit coupling and strain. We find that high spin polarization with large spin-polarized current is achieved in the spin energy gap. However, only one of the two modulations is present, no spin polarization can be generated. So the combination of the two modulations provides a way to design tunable spin polarization without need for a magnetic element or an external magnetic field.

26	Stable organic field-effect-transistors with high mobilities unaffected by supporting dielectric based on phenylene-bridged thienobenzothiophene	Mathis, T.; Liu, Y.; Ai, L.; Ge, Z.; Lumpi, D.; Horkel, E.; Holzer, B.; Froehlich, J.; Batlogg, B.	Journal of Applied Physics	20140130	We report on the electrical properties of organic field-effect transistors (OFET) based on a new class of organic semiconductors. The molecules consist of the same thieno[2,3-b][1]benzothiophene building blocks, connected by different ?-bridge spacers (ethylene, phenylene, and fluorophenylene). Molecular orbitals and highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies were calculated and compared with results from cyclic voltammetric and UV-vis absorption measurements. In order to study the influence of the bridge groups on the molecular arrangement and surface interaction, the transistor performance on a wide range of dielectrics has been investigated in detail. These include as grown SiO2 and Al2O3 and also treated with octadecyltrichrolosilane and octadecylphosphonic acid, as well as Cytop and Parylene C. An extended study of the multitude of combinations of these materials revealed mobilities up to ?1 cm2/Vs, measured for devices made of the phenylene-bridged compound. Surprisingly, the mobility was quite independent of the supporting gate dielectric. Stability over time has been observed with no degradation after 5 months. By eliminating the hysteresis using Cytop, we were able to show that some of the molecules form films without long-term charge carrier trapping. These are interesting features for practical industrial processing of organic electronics.

28	An Anarchy of Methods: Current Trends in How Intelligence Is Abstracted in AI	Lehman, Joel; Clune, Jeff; Risi, Sebastian	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20141211	"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a sprawling field encompassing a diversity of approaches to machine intelligence and disparate perspectives on how intelligence should be viewed. Because researchers often engage only within their own specialized area of AI, there are many interesting broad questions about AI as a whole that often go unanswered. How should intelligence be abstracted in AI research? Which subfields, techniques, and abstractions are most promising? Why do researchers bet their careers on the particular abstractions and techniques of their chosen subfield of AI? Should AI research be ""bio-inspired"" and remain faithful to the process that produced intelligence (evolution) or the biological substrate that enables it (networks of neurons)? Discussing these big-picture questions motivated us to organize an AAAI Fall Symposium, which gathered participants across AI subfields to present and debate their views.

It was found that the dual-wavelength pulse-trains possess different HML orders due to the different cavity nonlinear effects experienced by the two wavelengths. By properly adjusting the cavity parameters, dual-wavelength HML pulses with repetition rates of 388 and 239 MHz were achieved. Moreover, wavelength switchable operation of dual-wavelength HML pulses was also obtained. The experimental results reveal that the microfiber-based TI could indeed be employed as a high-performance dual-function photonic device with the saturable absorption and high nonlinear effects for the applications in fields of ultrafast and nonlinear photonics.

Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20140925	High-speed railway (HSR) brings convenience to peoples' lives and is generally considered as one of the most sustainable developments for ground transportation. One of the important parts of HSR construction is the signaling system, which is also called the ﾓoperation control system,ﾔ where wireless communications play a key role in the transmission of train control data. We discuss in detail the main differences in scientific research for wireless communications between the HSR operation scenarios and the conventional public land mobile scenarios. The latest research progress in wireless channel modeling in viaducts, cuttings, and tunnels scenarios are discussed. The characteristics of nonstationary channel and the line-of-sight (LOS) sparse and LOS multiple-input-multiple-output channels, which are the typical channels in HSR scenarios, are analyzed. Some novel concepts such as composite transportation and key challenging techniques such as train-to-train communication, vacuum maglev train techniques, the security for HSR, and the fifth-generation wireless communications related techniques for future HSR development for safer, more comfortable, and more secure HSR operation are also discussed.

33	A low-temperature processed environment-friendly full-organic carrier collection layer for polymer solar cells	Shi, Ai-Li; Li, Yan-Qing; Jiang, Xiao-Chen; Ma, Zhong-Sheng; Wang, Qian-Kun; Guo, Zhen-Yu; Zhang, Dan-Dan; Lee, Shuit-Tong; Tang, Jian-Xin	Applied Physics Letters	20140811	We constructed a concept of the full-organic carrier collection layer (CCL) used for polymer solar cells. The CCL is composed of dipyrazino[2,3-f:2',3'-h]quinoxaline-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexacarbonitrile as hole collection layer (HCL) and chlorine-free solvents (formic acid (FA)) processed 4,7-Diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen) as electron collection layer, exhibiting good solubility, and environmental protection. The FA based device shows ideal power conversion efficiency (3.75%), which is higher than that of control device (3.6%). Besides, the HCL shows a different mechanism in hole extraction by functioning as a charge recombination zone for electrons injected from anode and holes extracted from the donor materials.								
34	Effect of high conductivity amorphous InGaZnO active layer on the field effect mobility improvement of thin film transistors	Trinh, Thanh Thuy; Jang, Kyungsoo; Dao, Vinh Ai; Yi, Junsin	Journal of Applied Physics	20141206	High mobility thin film transistors (TFTs) with a high conductivity amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) active layer were successfully fabricated. The operation of the high-carrier-IGZO thin film transistor with a Schottky barrier (SB) was proposed and clearly experimentally explained. The switching characteristic of SB-TFT does not rely on the accumulation process but due to the Schottky barrier height control. Leakage current can be reduced by Schottky contact at the source/drain (S/D), while it was as high as the on current so that the switch properties could not achieve in ohmic ones. The a-IGZO SB-TFTs with Ag S/D contact express the high performance with ?FE of 20.4 cm2 V?1 s?1, Vth of 5.8 V, and ION/IOFF of 2 � 107 @ VD = 1V. The introduction of operating mechanism for TFTs using high conductivity a-IGZO promises an expansion study for other active layer materials.								
35	Instant Recommendation for Web Services Composition	Chen, L.; Wu, J.; Jian, H.; Deng, H.; Wu, Z.	Services Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20141212	Web service composition helps users integrate services to create new large-granularity and value-added composite services. Most recent studies have focused on automatic AI-Planning-based static or dynamic composition at functional- or process-level. However in industry, most business applications are still composed manually or semi-automatically with abundant domain expertise. Consequently, to build a good and reliable composite service is really a time-consuming and professional task. Inspired by the Instant Search of Google, we propose an Instant recommendation approach to provide optimal suggestions while a composition process incrementally proceeds. In our model, we fully utilize the execution log of composite services, and intend to identify appropriate services which have been proved to be more reliable and robust, therefore those services have higher probability to fulfill users' demands. To find the top-k possible composite services in real-time, we adopt the A* search algorithm with various pruning heuristics to dynamically expand the search space efficiently. Experiments on a real-world dataset with 15,959 real web services crawled from the Internet demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.	${rm A}^{ast}$;Bayes;Composite service;instant recommendation,Algorithm design and analysis;Information retrieval;Internet;Quality of service;Time complexity;Web services

37	The effect of defects on negative differential thermal resistance in symmetric graphene nanoribbons	Shao, Zhi-Gang; Ai, Bao-Quan; Zhong, Wei-Rong	Applied Physics Letters	20140111	Effect of defects on negative differential thermal resistance (NDTR) is investigated using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method for the symmetric graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with defects. Remarkably, it is found that NDTR will disappear as the number of defects increases. In addition, heat current of GNRs with defects is larger than that of the pristine GNRs when the temperature difference is larger. The results are explained qualitatively utilizing the theory of phonon spectra mismatch. The work may be useful in designing thermal-nano devices on the basis of GNRs.								
38	Growth of high-density Ir nanocrystals by atomic layer deposition for nonvolatile nanocrystal memory applications	Liu, Xiao-Jie; Zhu, Lin; Li, Xue-Fei; Cao, Zheng-Yi; Li, Ai-Dong; Wu, Di	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures	20140526	A careful investigation is made of the growth of Ir nanocrystals (NCs) on Al2O3 by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and a charge trapping memory device using ALD-grown Ir NCs as the charge trapping layer and ALD-grown Al2O3/HfO2 as the tunneling/blocking layers is fabricated. It is found that the ex situ nucleation of Ir NCs on ALD-grown Al2O3 is difficult, though in situ growth can produce pure metallic Ir NCs with a face-centered cubic crystalline phase directly on ALD-grown Al2O3 at the initial growth stage, which follows the nucleation incubation model. The growth of these metallic Ir NCs is attributed to the presence of a uniform coverage of reactive groups (hydroxyl or dimethylaluminum) on the as-deposited fresh ALD-grown Al2O3 surface, which greatly promotes the uniform nucleation of Ir. Electrical measurements of p-Si/Al2O3/Ir NCs/HfO2 memory cells exhibit a large memory window of 4.2 V at the sweeping gate voltage of �10 V, and a ?76% retention property after 104 s at 75 �C. Also, a stable memory window of ?2 V is achieved during the first 105 program/erase cycles under a �10 V/10 ms program/erase operation. In situ ALD-grown Ir NCs with the highest density of 0.6 � 1012/cm2 provide a potential approach to fabricate large-area high-density NCs for future ultrahigh-density nonvolatile NC memory applications.

40	Performance improvement of gadolinium oxide resistive random access memory treated by hydrogen plasma immersion ion implantation	Wang, Jer-Chyi; Hsu, Chih-Hsien; Ye, Yu-Ren; Ai, Chi-Fong; Tsai, Wen-Fa	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films	20140120	Characteristics improvement of gadolinium oxide (GdxOy) resistive random access memories (RRAMs) treated by hydrogen plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) was investigated. With the hydrogen PIII treatment, the GdxOy RRAMs exhibited low set/reset voltages and a high resistance ratio, which were attributed to the enhanced movement of oxygen ions within the GdxOy films and the increased Schottky barrier height at Pt/GdxOy interface, respectively. The resistive switching mechanism of GdxOy RRAMs was dominated by Schottky emission, as proved by the area dependence of the resistance in the low resistance state. After the hydrogen PIII treatment, a retention time of more than 104 s was achieved at an elevated measurement temperature. In addition, a stable cycling endurance with the resistance ratio of more than three orders of magnitude of the GdxOy RRAMs can be obtained.								
41	A DFA with Extended Character-Set for Fast Deep Packet Inspection	Cong Liu; Yan Pan; Ai Chen; Jie Wu	Computers, IEEE Transactions on	20140717	Deep packet inspection (DPI), based on regular expressions, is expressive, compact, and efficient in specifying attack signatures. We focus on their implementations based on general-purpose processors that are cost-effective and flexible to update. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, called deterministic finite automata with extended character-set (DFA/EC), which can significantly decrease the number of states through doubling the size of the character-set. Unlike existing state reduction algorithms, our solution requires only a single main memory access for each byte in the traffic payload, which is the minimum. We perform experiments with several Snort rule-sets. Results show that, compared to DFAs, DFA/ECs are very compact and are over four orders of magnitude smaller in the best cases; DFA/ECs also have smaller memory bandwidth and run faster. We believe that DFA/EC will lay a groundwork for a new type of state compression technique in fast packet inspection.

42	Development of an adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system based meta-model for estimating lightning related failures in polluted environments	Shariatinasab, R.; Safar, J.G.; Mobarakeh, M.A.	Science, Measurement & Technology, IET	20140708	Owing to the random nature of the lightning phenomenon, the statistical based methods such as Monte Carlo simulation are the best tool to perform the lightning-related studies. However, Monte Carlo simulation is complex and time consuming, especially, for larger networks where a lot of regions must be investigated, separately. Although some researches have been carried out to evaluate the lightning flashover outage rates based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, but, so far, any work has not been reported to perform a risk assessment of lightning surges by means of AI. This study presents a meta-model based on adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that can be utilised to perform the lightning-related risk analysis with a good accuracy. The inputs of ANFIS are tower footing resistance, critical flashover voltage and the rate of lightning occurrence; and its outputs include the failure risk of both the insulation and arrester. The trained ANFIS can be very efficient in terms of time and computational resources for the further analysis, like placement of arresters or insulation coordination studies, on the electrical network on which the training is performed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ANFIS meta-model, an optimisation method, based on genetic algorithm, has been implemented in order to find the optimum location of a specified set of line arresters on power network. Also, in order to consider the environmental condition, that is, pollution and altitude, a new method to determine the importance of each node of interest in protection is introduced.	adaptive systems;arresters;failure analysis;fuzzy logic;fuzzy neural nets;genetic algorithms;lightning;lightning protection;risk analysisANFIS meta-model;adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system based meta-model;arrester failure risk;critical flashover voltage;electrical network;environmental condition;genetic algorithm;insulation failure risk;lightning occurrence rate;lightning-related risk analysis;optimisation method;polluted environments;tower footing resistance							
43	Tunable radio-frequency negative permittivity in nickel-alumina ﾓnaturalﾔ meta-composites	Shi, Zhi-cheng; Chen, Shou-gang; Sun, Kai; Wang, Xin; Fan, Run-hua; Wang, Xu-ai	Applied Physics Letters	20140630	ﾓNaturalﾔ metamaterials with intrinsic negative permittivity and permeability have attracted significant attention because of their wide promising applications and facile preparation processes. In order to match the negative permeability band which is usually located in the radio-frequency range, radio-frequency negative permittivity is desired. Moreover, the negative permittivity should be tunable to satisfy different application circumstances. Herein, nickel/alumina composites consisting of nickel particles homogeneously dispersed in alumina were prepared using a facile wet chemical process. A percolation phenomenon appears, and expected radio-frequency negative permittivity is obtained. Furthermore, the dependences of negative permittivity on the composites' compositions and microstructures are investigated in detail. It is shown that higher nickel content results in higher negative permittivity magnitude and lower negative permittivity frequency. Besides, the addition of alumina particles leads to decreasing negative permittivity magnitude and higher negative permittivity frequency band owing to the deteriorated interconnectivity between nickel particles. The present work will greatly facilitate the fabrication and application of ﾓnaturalﾔ metamaterials with tailored properties.

Biomedical and Health Informatics, IEEE Journal of	20140901	One of the key points to maintain and boost research and development in the area of smart wearable systems (SWS) is the development of integrated architectures for intelligent services, as well as wearable systems and devices for health and wellness management. This paper presents such a generic architecture for multiparametric, intelligent and ubiquitous wireless sensing platforms. It is a transparent, smartphone-based sensing framework with customizable wireless interfaces and plug`n'play capability to easily interconnect third party sensor devices. It caters to wireless body, personal, and near-me area networks. A pivotal part of the platform is the integrated inference engine/runtime environment that allows the mobile device to serve as a user-adaptable personal health assistant. The novelty of this system lays in a rapid visual development and remote deployment model. The complementary visual Inference Engine Editor that comes with the package enables artificial intelligence specialists, alongside with medical experts, to build data processing models by assembling different components and instantly deploying them (remotely) on patient mobile devices. In this paper, the new logic-centered software architecture for ubiquitous health monitoring applications is described, followed by a discussion as to how it helps to shift focus from software and hardware development, to medical and health process-centered design of new SWS applications.

47	EvoMCTS: A Scalable Approach for General Game Learning	Benbassat, A.; Sipper, M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20141211	In this paper, we present the application of genetic programming as a generic game learning approach to zero-sum, deterministic, full-knowledge board games by evolving board-state evaluation functions to be used in conjunction with Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our method involves evolving board-evaluation functions that are then used to guide the MCTS playout strategy. We examine several variants of Reversi, Dodgem, and Hex using strongly typed genetic programming, explicitly defined introns, and a selective directional crossover method. Our results show a proficiency that surpasses that of baseline handcrafted players using equal and in some cases greater amounts of search, with little domain knowledge and no expert domain knowledge. Moreover, our results exhibit scalability.

48	AI for General Strategy Game Playing		Handbook of Digital Games	20140326	This chapter addresses the understudied question of how to create AI that plays strategy games, through building and comparing AI for general strategy game playing. The chapter enumerates a series of common characteristics of such a game. Many strategy games can be played in multiplayer mode, where human players compete with each other for domination. There has been extensive research done on AI for traditional board games. The chapter addresses the problem of general strategy game playing. The Strategy Game Description Language (SGDL) is a model-based approach to develop strategy games. The chapter presents 11 agents that are created based on several different techniques. The MinMax, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), potential field (PF), and neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) agents were determined to be adequate in various models and map combinations and thus are capable of general game play.								
49	Empirical Models for Extra Propagation Loss of Train Stations on High-Speed Railway	Ke Guan; Zhangdui Zhong; Bo Ai; Kurner, T.	Antennas and Propagation, IEEE Transactions on	20140227	Train stations are one of the largest and most unavoidable obstructions for electromagnetic wave propagation on a high-speed railway. They can bring about severe extra propagation loss, and therefore, lead to poor coverage or handover failure. However, their influence has been rarely investigated before. Based on rich experimental results of 930 MHz measurements conducted on train stations of high-speed railway in China, this paper proposes two empirical models for the extra propagation loss owing to train stations for the first time. The extra loss depends on four conditions: the distance between the transmitter (Tx) and the train station, the type of the train station, the track carrying the train, and the propagation mechanism zones. Hence, the models are established for every case of all the combinations of these four conditions. The validation shows that the proposed models accurately predict the extra propagation loss and support an effective way to involve the influence of the train station in the simulation and design of the signaling and train control communications systems.

50	Refractive Index Sensing Characteristics of Single-Mode Fiber-Based Modal Interferometers	Yaxun Zhang; Ai Zhou; Boyang Qin; Hongchang Deng; Zhihai Liu; Jun Yang; Libo Yuan	Lightwave Technology, Journal of	20140331	We present a theoretical and experimental investigation on refractive index (RI) sensing characteristics of single mode fiber (SMF) based modal interferometers. Theoretical analysis reveals that interference between different modes in an SMF has a quite different response to the RI variation of the external medium. The interference between the core and lower order cladding modes has negative RI sensitivity whereas that between the core and higher order modes, or between two different order cladding modes have positive sensitivity. A single-mode-multimode-single-mode (SMS) fiber Michelson interferometer with a large-core step-index multimode fiber (MMF) is employed for experimental verification. In the SMS-based Michelson interferometer, the MMF acts as a mode coupler to excite cladding modes in the SMF. The RI response of the SMS-based structures with two different lengths of MMF are respectively tested in sodium-chloride water solutions. Experimental results show excellent agreements with the theoretical analysis.

52	Efficiency of GDL Reasoners	Schiffel, S.; Bjornsson, Y.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20141211	The variety of open-source game description language (GDL) reasoners available to newcomers to general game playing (GGP) lowers the technical barrier of entering the field. This variety, however, also makes it more complicated to decide on a fitting reasoner for a given GGP project, considering the project's objectives, ambitions, and technical constraints. This paper gives an overview of available GDL reasoners, discusses their main pros and cons, and, most importantly, quantifies their relative reasoning performance on a number of games (in terms of nodes searched per second), showing two orders of magnitude difference in some cases. We similarly quantify the performance difference between game playing systems specifically designed for playing a single game on the one hand, and GGP systems on the other hand, witnessing up to several orders of magnitude difference.

53	Social Network Services for Rail Traffic Applications	Ai, Bo; Cheng, Xiang; Yang, Liuqing; Zhong, Zhang-Dui; Ding, Jian-Wen; Song, Hua	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20141211	"With the rapid development of high-speed railway, subway, city railway, and intercity rail, how to ensure the reliability, safety, and comfort of such rail traffic transportation systems becomes the focus. Meanwhile, the social network service (SNS) is advancing so fast all over the world. How to combine the characteristics of rail traffic transportation systems with that of the social networks, which enable them to play an important role in the rail traffic operations, will become one of the core problems in the future development of intelligent rail traffic transportation systems. Based on the business requirements, the reliable transmission of information, and the characteristics of the rail traffic transportation systems, this article proposes a new concept of ""dedicated social network"" whose information are exchanged within the internal intranet. A novel social network architecture for rail traffic transportation system is proposed, including the SNS Management Center, a dedicated social network for internal information exchanges among the drivers, the dispatchers, and the train control center, the SNS for the information exchanges among the train marshals, crews, and passengers.

55	Adaptive Generative Models for Digital Wireless Channels	Salih, O.S.; Cheng-Xiang Wang; Bo Ai; Mesleh, R.	Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20140908	Generative models, which can generate bursty error sequences with similar burst error statistics to those of descriptive models, have an immense impact on the wireless communications industry as they can significantly reduce the computational time of simulating wireless communication links. Adaptive generative models aim to produce any error sequences with any given signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) by using only two reference error sequences obtained from a reference transmission system with two different SNRs. Compared with traditional generative models, this adaptive technique can further considerably reduce the computational load of generating new error sequences as there is no need to simulate the whole reference transmission system again. In this paper, reference error sequences are provided by computer simulations of a long term evolution (LTE) system. Adaptive generative models are developed from three widely used generative models, namely, the simplified Fritchman model (SFM), the Baum-Welch based hidden Markov model (BWHMM), and the deterministic process based generative model (DPBGM). It is demonstrated that the adaptive DPBGM can provide accurate burst error statistics and bit error rate (BER) performance of the LTE system, while the adaptive SFM and adaptive BWHMM fail to do so.

56	Automated Story Selection for Color Commentary in Sports	Lee, G.; Bulitko, V.; Ludvig, E.A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	Automated sports commentary is a form of automated narrative. Sports commentary exists to keep the viewer informed and entertained. One way to entertain the viewer is by telling brief stories relevant to the game in progress. We present a system called the sports commentary recommendation system (SCoReS) that can automatically suggest stories for commentators to tell during games. Through several user studies, we compared commentary using SCoReS to three other types of commentary and show that SCoReS adds significantly to the broadcast across several enjoyment metrics. We also collected interview data from professional sports commentators who positively evaluated a demonstration of the system. We conclude that SCoReS can be a useful broadcast tool, effective at selecting stories that add to the enjoyment and watchability of sports. SCoReS is a step toward automating sports commentary and, thus, automating narrative.

58	Skald: Minstrel Reconstructed	Tearse, B.; Mawhorter, P.; Mateas, M.; Wardrip-Fruin, N.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	Scott Turner's Minstrel is considered a landmark story-generation system, cited as an important system in our field's history for the quality of its output. Other influential systems such as Meehan's Tale-Spin have inspired modern successors, but although a few systems have followed Minstrel's case-based approach, none of them use its ﾓimaginative recallﾔ technique. This paper details Skald, a publicly-released rational reconstruction of Minstrel that enables exploration of Turner's work and discovery of new implications for future research. A key finding is a brittleness only hinted at in Turner's publications: the story library, story templates, and the recall system must be tailored to one another for Turner's original system to function. We show that this can be ameliorated through a number of techniques, however, from adding differential costs to transformations to removing the least-successful author-level actions. Another key finding is that Turner's original ﾓboredomﾔ system limited leverage of the story library. An alternative and its results are presented here. What emerges from this work is a different picture of the original Minstrel than that currently present in the literature, as well as a new system, Skald, that sets the stage for future research to explore Turner's ideas for story generation.

59	The exchange interaction values of perovskite-type materials EuTiO3 and EuZrO3	Hu, Ai-Yuan; Wang, Huai-Yu	Journal of Applied Physics	20141124	A comprehensive research of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) structures of perovskite-type EuTiO3 and EuZrO3 is carried out by use of the double-time Green's function. All three possible types of AFM configurations are considered, and theoretical results are compared to experiments to extract the exchange parameters J1 and J2 values. The obtained exchanges are employed to calculate the magnetic susceptibility, which is then, in turn, compared to experiments. In this way, we can be certain that the EuZrO3, as well as EuTiO3, is of the G-type structure ever conjectured, and A- and C-types are ruled out. Our achieved J1 and J2 values are compared with those obtained by the mean field approximation and Monte Carlo simulation, and better agree with experiments.								
60	Decaying Simulation Strategies	Tak, M.J.W.; Winands, M.H.M.; Bjornsson, Y.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20141211	The aim of general game playing (GGP) is to create programs capable of playing a wide range of different games at an expert level, given only the rules of the game. The most successful GGP programs currently employ simulation-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The performance of MCTS depends heavily on the simulation strategy used. In this paper, we investigate the application of a decay factor for two domain-independent simulation strategies: the $N$-gram selection technique (NST) and the move-average sampling technique (MAST). Three decay factor methods, called move decay, batch decay, and simulation decay, are applied. Furthermore, a combination of move decay and simulation decay is also tested. The decay variants are implemented in the GGP program CadiaPlayer. Four types of games are used: turn taking, simultaneous move, one player, and multiplayer.

62	Mobility-driven networks (MDN): from evolution to visions of mobility management	Shanzhi Chen; Yan Shi; Bo Hu; Ming Ai	Network, IEEE	20140724	Mobility is nature in the world and has evolved into an inherent feature and a key driving force of the future network, although only treated as one aspect in a specific network when it originated in a cellular system. Confronting emerging communication paradigms such as mobile social networks, mobile cloud computing, Internet-of-Things, and the expectation of ubiquitous and seamless connectivity, the existing mobility management technologies face problems such as function redundancy, system complexity, and inefficiency. In this article we propose Mobility-Driven Network (MDN) as the vision of mobility management under a systematic and unified methodology. The design philosophy of vertical decoupling the mobility entity into service-entity and device-entity, and horizontal decoupling the entity-identity and locator-identifier, are both discussed. The design philosophy is applied in the proposed function reference model and protocol reference model of MDN to abstract the mobility support functions, entities, and principles. Finally, the open issues in MDN are discussed.	,Cellular networks;Handover;Internet;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile radio mobility management,cellular radio;mobility management (mobile radio);protocolsMDN;cellular system;entity-identity;function reference model;horizontal decoupling;locator-identifier;mobility management;mobility-driven network;protocol reference model;systematic methodology;unified methodology;vertical decoupling

A fourth-order and a fifth-order grid multiscroll chaotic system are presented by designing staircase function and shifted voltage sign functions in the high-order Jerk system. Using the CCIIs, a chaotic circuit is designed and implemented, which can generate 4 � 2 � 2 � 2- and 4 � 2 � 2 � 2 � 2-scroll chaotic attractors, respectively, via switching control. Compared with the voltage operational-amplifier-based circuit, the proposed circuit has better performance in terms of circuit structure and bandwidth.

65	DeepQA Jeopardy! Gamification: A Machine-Learning Perspective	Baughman, A.K.; Chuang, W.; Dixon, K.R.; Benz, Z.; Basilico, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140313	DeepQA is a large-scale natural language processing (NLP) question-and-answer system that responds across a breadth of structured and unstructured data, from hundreds of analytics that are combined with over 50 models, trained through machine learning. After the 2011 historic milestone of defeating the two best human players in the Jeopardy! game show, the technology behind IBM Watson, DeepQA, is undergoing gamification into real-world business problems. Gamifying a business domain for Watson is a composite of functional, content, and training adaptation for nongame play. During domain gamification for medical, financial, government, or any other business, each system change affects the machine-learning process. As opposed to the original Watson Jeopardy!, whose class distribution of positive-to-negative labels is 1:100, in adaptation the computed training instances, question-and-answer pairs transformed into true-false labels, result in a very low positive-to-negative ratio of 1:100 000. Such initial extreme class imbalance during domain gamification poses a big challenge for the Watson machine-learning pipelines. The combination of ingested corpus sets, question-and-answer pairs, configuration settings, and NLP algorithms contribute toward the challenging data state. We propose several data engineering techniques, such as answer key vetting and expansion, source ingestion, oversampling classes, and question set modifications to increase the computed true labels. In addition, algorithm engineering, such as an implementation of the Newton-Raphson logistic regression with a regularization term, relaxes the constraints of class imbalance during training adaptation. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that data and algorithm engineering are complementary and indispensable to overcome the challenges in this first Watson gamification for real-world business problems.

66	Quantitative relationship between interfacial misfit and in-plane grain size of ZnO film	Cao, Shan Peng; Ye, Fei; Xu, Ai Yan; Zhang, Xiang Yu; Bai, Fei Ming	Journal of Applied Physics	20141229	The in-plane grain sizes of ZnO films deposited on Si (100), (110), and (111) substrates have been investigated to quantitatively understand the relationship between the grain size and the interfacial misfit. The mean in-plane grain sizes at the latter stage of island growth in the vicinity of the interfaces are measured to be 5.6 nm, 6.5 nm, and 5.0 nm, respectively. At the initial stage of continuous film formation, the grain sizes increase and the grains of the films on Si (100) and (110) substrates elongate in  [21ﾯ1ﾯ0] ZnO direction. These grain sizes are dominated by the interfacial misfit and the elastic strain energy at the interfaces. Then, the grain sizes at the latter stage of island growth and the initial stage of continuous film formation are explained by the O-lattice calculation and the interfacial energy calculation, respectively. The calculated grain sizes are consistent with the observations.

By properly rotating the polarization controller, up to 11 lasing lines in a 3-dB bandwidth with 0.184-nm channel spacing were obtained. In addition, the lasing locations can be flexibly tuned by virtue of spectral filtering effect induced by the polarization-dependent isolator and the intracavity birefringence. The results demonstrated that the MKR could be employed as a high performance comb filter to realize a compact multiwavelength fiber laser.

68	Lessons on Using Computationally Generated Influence for Shaping Narrative Experiences	Roberts, D.L.; Isbell, C.L.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	In this paper, we present computational models for generating influence that allow story managers to shape players' decisions in interactive narrative experiences. Our approach uses concepts from social psychology, discourse analysis, and natural language generation. We describe an abstract formalism to operationalize tools of social psychological influence described by Cialdini (Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, New York, NY, USA: Harper-Collins, 1998) and evaluate two example implementations that enable a storytelling system to generate influence on the fly (with varying degrees of success), thereby adapting stories to realize goals specified by authors. These implementations are used in an interactive story where influence is generated dynamically as players' experiences unfold. We present the results of a user study to characterize the effectiveness of these models. Results did not indicate the presence of any significant differences in players' sense of control over the story with, or without, the use of influence. Further, the use of influence resulted in a set of stories experienced by players that more closely matched the author's goals.

Hydrogen ions were implanted at the Pt/GdxOy interface to modify the oxygen-vacancy distribution, which was examined by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. After the hydrogen PIII treatment, a forming process is needed to operate the GdxOy memristors and the RS mechanism is changed from Schottky emission to space-charge-limited conduction. Superior multilevel RS properties such as data retention for more than 104 s at 85ﾰC, and sequentially cycling test for more than 103 times with a resistance ratio of approximately one order of magnitude between each state are realized, making the future high-density flash memory possible.

70	Good Machine Performance in Turing's Imitation Game	Warwick, K.; Shah, H.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140911	In this paper, we consider transcripts which originated from a practical series of Turing's Imitation Game that was held on June 23, 2012, at Bletchley Park, U.K. In some cases, the tests involved a three-participant simultaneous comparison of two hidden entities, whereas others were the result of a direct two-participant interaction. Each of the transcripts considered here resulted in a human interrogator being fooled, by a machine, into concluding that they had been conversing with a human. Particular features of the conversation are highlighted, successful ploys on the part of each machine are discussed, and likely reasons for the interrogator being fooled are considered. Subsequent feedback from the interrogators involved is also included.

72	Digital beamforming techniques applied to satellite-based AIS receiver	Maggio, F.; Rossi, T.; Cianca, E.; Ruggieri, M.	Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, IEEE	20140730	This article investigates using DBF onboard AIS satellites with the objective to increase the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) so that the number of decoded AIS messages can be increased. A DBF system is based on an array of antenna elements acting as independent receivers that capture radio frequency (RF) signals. These signals are converted into two digital streams of baseband I and Q signals, and then they are weighted (by changing their amplitude and phase) so that when they are combined together (summed) they create a desired output (i.e., the AIS signal of interest with a high level of SINR). The article presents an antenna array with a single-element radiation pattern optimized to mitigate interference. Based on this antenna array, static and adaptive DBF techniques have been compared in terms of SINR increase and system complexity (i.e., need for a large antenna, computational complexity of an adaptive DBF technique, etc.).	,Array signal processing;Digital systems;Identigy management systems;Interference;Marine vehicles;Receivers;Safety;Satellites;Signal to noise ratio;Transponders,antenna radiation patterns;array signal processing;interference suppression;radio receivers;satellite antennasDBF onboard AIS satellites;RF signals;SINR;adaptive DBF techniques;antenna array;baseband I signals;baseband Q signals;decoded AIS messages;digital beamforming techniques;digital streams;independent receivers;interference mitigatione;radio frequency signals;satellite-based AIS receiver;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;single-element radiation pattern;static DBF techniques							
73	Solving the Physical Traveling Salesman Problem: Tree Search and Macro Actions	Perez, D.; Powley, E.J.; Whitehouse, D.; Rohlfshagen, P.; Samothrakis, S.; Cowling, P.I.; Lucas, S.M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140313	This paper presents a number of approaches for solving a real-time game consisting of a ship that must visit a number of waypoints scattered around a 2-D maze full of obstacles. The game, the Physical Traveling Salesman Problem (PTSP), which featured in two IEEE conference competitions during 2012, provides a good balance between long-term planning (finding the optimal sequence of waypoints to visit), and short-term planning (driving the ship in the maze). This paper focuses on the algorithm that won both PTSP competitions: it takes advantage of the physics of the game to calculate the optimal order of waypoints, and it employs Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to drive the ship. The algorithm uses repetitions of actions (macro actions) to reduce the search space for navigation. Variations of this algorithm are presented and analyzed, in order to understand the strength of each one of its constituents and to comprehend what makes such an approach the best controller found so far for the PTSP.

The M2 parameter of was preserved at any power level without mode instability. What is more, the evolution of the beam quality and the mode field experimentally verifies the superior thermal-optical property of the high power fiber lasers compared with other bulk solid-state lasers because of their geometry of the gain medium.

75	Detecting Anomalies from a Multitarget Tracking Output	Ristic, B.	Aerospace and Electronic Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20140502	Surveillance systems typically incorporate multitarget tracking algorithms for sequential estimation of kinematic states (e.g. positions, velocities) of moving objects in the surveillance domain of interest. This letter proposes an algorithm for online detection of anomalies in the motion and the count of objects, using the output of a multiobject tracking algorithm. The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process. During the unsupervised learning phase, the parameters of the Poisson point process are estimated for each cell. The testing phase is performed sequentially by threshold detection at a specified level of significance. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset in the context of maritime surveillance.	,Kernel;Kinematics;Partitioning algorithms;Surveillance;Testing;Tracking;Vectors,object tracking;target tracking;video surveillancePoisson point process;automatic identification system dataset;kinematic states;maritime surveillance;multiobject tracking algorithm;multitarget tracking algorithms;online anomaly detection;sequential estimation;unsupervised learning phase							
76	Steady-State and Dynamic Input Current Low-Frequency Ripple Evaluation and Reduction in Two-Stage Single-Phase Inverters With Back Current Gain Model	Jianhua Wang; Baojian Ji; Xuqian Lu; Xiang Deng; Fanghua Zhang; Chunying Gong	Power Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20140326	Due to nonlinear time-varying characteristic of a single-phase dc/ac inverter, its front-end dc/dc converter tends to draw an alternate current ripple current at twice the output frequency, which may cause interaction issues, e.g., stability problem and input ripple current limit in distributed generation systems. A novel method is proposed to evaluate the behavior of low-frequency input current ripple. This approach is based on back current gain Ai (s) (input current to output current) model of the dc/dc converter. The theoretic model with different control schemes is verified in Saber environment. It is indicated and proved that the average current mode control strategy is more effective as compared with linear voltage mode control and open-loop control schemes. Design principles are presented based on Ai (s) as guidelines. Dynamic response with bandwidth limitation is also discussed and improved with proposed proportional-resonant (PR) filter placed based on Ai (s) model. Detail simulation and experiment results for different linear control and nonlinear control strategies, 50 and 400 Hz, buck-type stand-alone two-stage single-phase systems are provided to verify the proposed back current gain model and PR-filter solutions.

77	Automatic Channel Fault Detection on a Small Animal APD-Based Digital PET Scanner	Charest, J.; Beaudoin, J.-F.; Cadorette, J.; Lecomte, R.; Brunet, C.-A.; Fontaine, R.	Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions on	20141009	Avalanche photodiode (APD) based positron emission tomography (PET) scanners show enhanced imaging capabilities in terms of spatial resolution and contrast due to the one to one coupling and size of individual crystal-APD detectors. However, to ensure the maximal performance, these PET scanners require proper calibration by qualified scanner operators, which can become a cumbersome task because of the huge number of channels they are made of. An intelligent system (IS) intends to alleviate this workload by enabling a diagnosis of the observational errors of the scanner. The IS can be broken down into four hierarchical blocks: parameter extraction, channel fault detection, prioritization and diagnosis. One of the main activities of the IS consists in analyzing available channel data such as: normalization coincidence counts and single count rates, crystal identification classification data, energy histograms, APD bias and noise thresholds to establish the channel health status that will be used to detect channel faults. This paper focuses on the first two blocks of the IS: parameter extraction and channel fault detection. The purpose of the parameter extraction block is to process available data on individual channels into parameters that are subsequently used by the fault detection block to generate the channel health status. To ensure extensibility, the channel fault detection block is divided into indicators representing different aspects of PET scanner performance: sensitivity, timing, crystal identification and energy. Some experiments on a 8 cm axial length LabPET scanner located at the Sherbrooke Molecular Imaging Center demonstrated an erroneous channel fault detection rate of 10% (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [9, 11]) which is considered tolerable. Globally, the IS achieves a channel fault detection efficiency of 96% (CI: [95, 97]), which proves that many faults can be detected automatically. Increased fault detection efficiency would be advantage- us but, the achieved results would already benefit scanner operators in their maintenance task.

79	A Novel Hierarchical Ship Classifier for COSMO-SkyMed SAR Data	Chao Wang; Hong Zhang; Fan Wu; Shaofeng Jiang; Bo Zhang; Yixian Tang	Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, IEEE	20131125	Ship monitoring has a wide range of applications in marine activities and maritime management. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has an advantage in ship detection over a vast region compared to other technologies. Recently, high-resolution SAR satellites have made ship recognition and classification possible from space. In July 2010, a ship recognition campaign was performed in the East China Sea. In situ investigation of ship types was carried out during the periods when the Italian COSMO-SkyMed satellites passed over the test site. Automatic Identification System (AIS) information was collected. Based on this information, a novel hierarchical ship classifier for COSMO-SkyMed SAR data was proposed. A total of 41 ship chips were cut from the SAR images for later classification. After preprocessing of the ship chips, geometric and backscattering characteristics of various ship types were analyzed. The ships were classified into bulk carriers, container ships, and oil tankers, with an accuracy of 93.3%, 80.0%, and 72.7%, respectively. Further investigation of the backscattering features with various illumination conditions is still in progress.

80	Full Evaluation of Polarization Characteristics of Multifunctional Integrated Optic Chip With High Accuracy	Jun Yang; Yonggui Yuan; Ai Zhou; Jun Cai; Chuang Li; Dekai Yan; Sheng Huang; Feng Peng; Bing Wu; Yu Zhang; Zhihai Liu; Libo Yuan	Lightwave Technology, Journal of	20140916	The polarization characteristics of the multifunctional integrated optic chip (MFIOC) are fully evaluated with high accuracy by using optical coherence domain polarimetry based on white light interferometer. Two polarization maintaining (PM) fibers, serving as extended fibers, are spliced to the PM pigtails of the MFIOC with polarization axes aligned. By launching light at 45ﾰ to the birefringence axes of the lead-in extended PM fiber, the beams along the fast and slow axes of the birefringent waveguides interfere after a 45ﾰ polarization analyzer and an optical path correlator. The polarization extinction ratio (PER) and birefringence of the LiNbO3 Y-waveguide, the birefringence of the PM pigtails, and the crosstalks at the connection points between the Y-waveguide and the PM pigtails can be simultaneously obtained from the amplitudes and positions of the corresponding interference peaks. The characteristic peak of the Y-waveguide's PER is shifted out of the interference peak of the light source ripple by selecting proper length of the extended fibers. The extended fibers also brings in two additional cross-coupling points at the ends of the PM pigtails, which are used for calculating the birefringence of the PM pigtails. In addition, the alignment type between the PM pigtails and the birefringent Y-waveguide is identified according to the position of the characteristic peak of the Y-waveguide's PER. Theoretical model based on Jones matrix is built to describe the characteristic peaks of the MFIOC. Two MFIOCs with different alignment angle between the PM pigtails and the Y-waveguide are experimentally tested. Results show that the PER resolution of the proposed method can achieve nearly -90 dB and the dynamic range of the test system is about 90 dB.

High absorptivity over an ultrawide spectrum is achieved by the combination of an artificial impedance surface (AIS) and a resistor-capacitor (RC) layer. In addition, the unique hexagonal shape of an AIS and RC layer enables polarization insensitivity. A circuit analysis is introduced based on a transmission-line model and shows good agreement with the full-wave analysis. Fabrication tolerance issues are considered with parametric studies in the electromagnetic simulation. The proposed absorber is fabricated on low-cost FR4 substrates, and its absorption performance is experimentally demonstrated at different angles and polarizations of incident electric fields.

82	The Game Description Language Is Turing Complete	Saffidine, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20141211	In this short paper, we show that the game description language (GDL) is Turing complete. In particular, we show how to simulate a Turing machine (TM) as a single-player game described in GDL. Positions in the game correspond to configurations of the machine, and the TM accepts its input exactly when the agent has a winning strategy from the initial position. As direct consequences of the Turing completeness of GDL, we show that well formedness as well as some other properties of a GDL description are undecidable. We propose to strengthen the recursion restriction of the original GDL specification into a general recursion restriction. The restricted language is not Turing complete, and the aforementioned properties become decidable. Checking whether a game description satisfies the suggested restriction is as easy as checking that the game is syntactically correct. Finally, we argue that practical expressivity is not affected as all syntactically correct games in a collection of more than 500 games having appeared in previous general game playing (GGP) competitions belong to the proposed GDL fragment.

83	Active acoustic metamaterials with tunable effective mass density by gradient magnetic fields	Chen, Xing; Xu, Xianchen; Ai, Shigang; Chen, HaoSen; Pei, Yongmao; Zhou, Xiaoming	Applied Physics Letters	20140828	Magnetically controlled acoustic metamaterials are designed and experimentally studied. Magneto-acoustic metamaterials are fabricated by covering an aluminum circular ring with magnetorheological elastomer. The resonant frequency of the structured elastomer is actively tunable by external gradient magnetic field, allowing for values of effective mass density of metamaterials to be adjusted in the low-frequency region. A prestressed plate theory is proposed to explain the shifting of the resonant frequency induced by the magnetic field and coincides very well with the experimental results. It is found that the tunability of magneto-acoustic metamaterials is attributed to the competition between the magnetic-field-induced prestress and the structural flexural rigidity. The proposed magneto-acoustic metamaterials realize the dynamic tuning of effective mass density with non-contact and fast-response gradient magnetic fields, providing a degree of freedom for full control of sound.

85	Real-Time Monte Carlo Tree Search in Ms Pac-Man	Pepels, T.; Winands, M.H.M.; Lanctot, M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140911	In this paper, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is introduced for controlling the Pac-Man character in the real-time game Ms Pac-Man. MCTS is used to find an optimal path for an agent at each turn, determining the move to make based on the results of numerous randomized simulations. Several enhancements are introduced in order to adapt MCTS to the real-time domain. Ms Pac-Man is an arcade game, in which the protagonist has several goals but no conclusive terminal state. Unlike games such as Chess or Go there is no state in which the player wins the game. Instead, the game has two subgoals, 1) surviving and 2) scoring as many points as possible. Decisions must be made in a strict time constraint of 40 ms. The Pac-Man agent has to compete with a range of different ghost teams, hence limited assumptions can be made about their behavior. In order to expand the capabilities of existing MCTS agents, four enhancements are discussed: 1) a variable-depth tree; 2) simulation strategies for the ghost team and Pac-Man; 3) including long-term goals in scoring; and 4) reusing the search tree for several moves with a decay factor ?. The agent described in this paper was entered in both the 2012 World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI'12, Brisbane, Qld., Australia) and the 2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG'12, Granada, Spain) Pac-Man Versus Ghost Team competitions, where it achieved second and first places, respectively. In the experiments, we show that using MCTS is a viable technique for the Pac-Man agent. Moreover, the enhancements improve overall performance against four different ghost teams.

86	Passing a Hide-and-Seek Third-Person Turing Test	Cenkner, A.; Bulitko, V.; Spetch, M.; Legge, E.; Anderson, C.G.; Brown, M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140313	Hiding and seeking are cognitive abilities frequently demonstrated by humans in both real life and video games. To determine to which extent these abilities can be replicated with AI, we introduce a specialized version of the Turing test for hiding and seeking. We then develop a computer agent that passes the test by appearing indistinguishable from human behavior to a panel of human judges. We analyze the AI techniques that enable the agent to imitate human hide-and-seek behavior and their relative contribution to the agent's performance.

87	Examination of Hand Muscle Activation and Motor Unit Indices Derived from Surface EMG in Chronic Stroke	Xiaoyan Li; Jie Liu; Sheng Li; Ying-Chih Wang; Ping Zhou	Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20141120	In this study, we used muscle and motor unit indices, derived from convenient surface electromyography (EMG) measurements, for examination of paretic muscle changes post stroke. For 12 stroke subjects, compound muscle action potential and voluntary surface EMG signals were recorded from paretic and contralateral first dorsal interosseous, abductor pollicis brevis, and abductor digiti minimi muscles. Muscle activation index (AI), motor unit number index (MUNIX), and motor unit size index (MUSIX) were then calculated for each muscle. There was a significant AI reduction for all the three muscles in paretic side compared with contralateral side, providing an evidence of muscle activation deficiency after stroke. The hand MUNIX (defined by summing the values from the three muscles) was significantly reduced in paretic side compared with contralateral side, whereas the hand MUSIX was not significantly different. Furthermore, diverse changes in MUNIX and MUSIX were observed from the three muscles. A major feature of the present examinations is the primary reliance on surface EMG, which offers practical benefits because it is noninvasive, induces minimal discomfort and can be performed quickly.

88	Oxygen plasma immersion ion implantation treatment to enhance data retention of tungsten nanocrystal nonvolatile memory	Wang, Jer-Chyi; Chang, Wei-Cheng; Lai, Chao-Sung; Chang, Li-Chun; Ai, Chi-Fong; Tsai, Wen-Fa	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films	20140111	Data retention characteristics of tungsten nanocrystal (W-NC) memory devices using an oxygen plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) treatment are investigated. With an increase of oxygen PIII bias voltage and treatment time, the capacitanceﾖvoltage hysteresis memory window is increased but the data retention characteristics become degraded. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images show that this poor data retention is a result of plasma damage on the tunneling oxide layer, which can be prevented by lowering the bias voltage to 7 kV. In addition, by using the elevated temperature retention measurement technique, the effective charge trapping level of the WO3 film surrounding the W-NCs can be extracted. This measurement reveals that a higher oxygen PIII bias voltage and treatment time induces more shallow traps within the WO3 film, degrading the retention behavior of the W-NC memory.								
89	Bias compensation-based recursive least-squares estimation with forgetting factors for output error moving average systems	Ai-Guo Wu; Yang-Yang Qian; Wei-Jun Wu	Signal Processing, IET	20140630	The bias compensation technique combined with the least-squares estimation algorithm with forgetting factors is applied to the parameter estimation of output error models with moving average noise. It is shown that the bias term induced by the noise is determined by the weighted average variance of the white noise and the parameters of the unknown noise model. Therefore, in order to give a recursive estimation of the bias term, an interactive estimation of the weighted average variance and noise parameters is constructed by using the principle of hierarchical identification. In addition, a recursive form is also established to estimate the so-called weighted average variance of the white noise. The estimation algorithm is finally established by combining the interactive estimation and the recursive estimation of weighted average variance. A simulation example is employed to show the effectiveness of the proposed bias compensation based least-squares estimation algorithm with two forgetting factors.	autoregressive moving average processes;compensation;least squares approximations;recursive estimation;signal processing;white noisebias compensation-based recursive least-squares estimation algorithm;hierarchical identification;interactive estimation;output error models;output error moving average systems;parameter estimation;weighted average variance;white noise							
90	Social Story Worlds With Comme il Faut	McCoy, J.; Treanor, M.; Samuel, B.; Reed, A.A.; Mateas, M.; Wardrip-Fruin, N.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	This paper presents Comme il Faut (CiF), an artificial intelligence system that matches character performances to appropriate social context, with the goal of enabling authors to write high-level rules governing expected character behavior in given social situations, rather than specific fixed choice points in a curated narrative structure. CiF models characters with a complex set of traits, feelings, and relationships, who can form intents, take actions, relate to a shared cultural space, and remember and refer to past events. A set of authored rules encoding appropriate behavior within a specific story world allow these characters to select actions to take (and respond to actions by others) in a manner consistent with their own personal and social concerns as well as a shifting interpersonal context. Through the development and release of Prom Week, a complete game using CiF as its narrative engine, we show how the system successfully creates complex narratives that are unique for each player and directed by those players' attempts to make progress towards story goals. We also show how CiF continues to be used in several in-progress interactive experiences (Mismanor and IMMERSE), speaking to the utility and flexibility of its design.

91	Two Online Learning Playout Policies in Monte Carlo Go: An Application of Win/Loss States	Basaldua, J.; Stewart, S.; Moreno-Vega, J.M.; Drake, P.D.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140313	Recently, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has become the dominant algorithm in Computer Go. This paper compares two simulation algorithms known as playout policies. The base policy includes some mandatory domain-specific knowledge such as seki and urgency patterns, but is still simple to implement. The more advanced learning policy combines two different learning algorithms with those implemented in the base policy. This policy makes use of win/loss states (WLSs) to learn win rates for large sets of features. A very large experimental series of 7960 games includes results for different board sizes, in self-play and against a reference opponent: Fuego. Results are given for equal numbers of simulations and equal central processing unit (CPU) allocation. The improvement is around 100 Elo points, even with equal CPU allocation, and it increases with the number of simulations. Analyzing the proportion of moves generated by each part of the policy and the individual impact of each part provides further insight on how the policy is learning.

92	Two-stage hot-carrier-induced degradation of p-type LDMOS transistors	Chen, J.F.; Tzu-Hsiang Chen; Deng-Ren Ai	Electronics Letters	20141113	Hot-carrier-induced device degradation of high-voltage p-type lateral diffused metal-oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) transistors is investigated. A two-stage linear region drain current (IDlin) shift (IDlin shift increases rapidly at the beginning of stress but tends to saturate when the stress time is longer) is observed. Technology computer-aided-design simulations and direct current current-voltage measurement results suggest that the decrease of residual fabrication interface traps (NIT) leads to an initial increase in IDlin shift. On the other hand, two competing mechanisms, i.e. increase in NIT generation and increase in electron trapping, are responsible for the saturated IDlin shift when the stress time is longer.

94	Ferroic characterizations, phase transformation, and internal bias field in 0.75Pb(Fe2/3W1/3)O3ﾖ0.25PbTiO3 multiferroic ceramic	Zheng, Mupeng; Hou, Yudong; Ai, Zhirong; Zhu, Mankang	Journal of Applied Physics	20141002	The complex perovskite of 0.75Pb(Fe2/3W1/3)O3ﾖ0.25PbTiO3 (0.75PFW-0.25PT) ceramic was prepared by the conventional oxide mixing method. The detailed microstructure of 0.75PFW-0.25PT ceramic was investigated. At room temperature, the TEM analysis reveals that only cubic structure (nonpolar) exists, which is different from the phase coexistence of cubic (66%) and tetragonal (34%) structure revealed by XRD. A mechanism dominated by a temperature rise due to electron-beam irradiation has been proposed. The XPS measurement confirms the mixed balance state of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the as-prepared 0.75PFW-0.25PT specimen, which facilitates the formation of the defect dipoles with oxygen vacancies, in turn resulting in the internal-bias field (Ei) phenomenon. The appearance of weak magnetic interactions is believed relating to the presence of noncompensated magnetic moments in Fe-rich islands. These results provide key information for understanding the composition, defect, ferroelectric, and ferromagnetic properties in 0.75PFW-0.25PT ceramic.								
95	General Self-Motivation and Strategy Identification: Case Studies Based on Sokoban and Pac-Man	Anthony, T.; Polani, D.; Nehaniv, C.L.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140313	In this paper, we use empowerment, a recently introduced biologically inspired measure, to allow an AI player to assign utility values to potential future states within a previously unencountered game without requiring explicit specification of goal states. We further introduce strategic affinity, a method of grouping action sequences together to form ﾓstrategies,ﾔ by examining the overlap in the sets of potential future states following each such action sequence. We also demonstrate an information-theoretic method of predicting future utility. Combining these methods, we extend empowerment to soft-horizon empowerment which enables the player to select a repertoire of action sequences that aim to maintain anticipated utility. We show how this method provides a proto-heuristic for nonterminal states prior to specifying concrete game goals, and propose it as a principled candidate model for ﾓintuitiveﾔ strategy selection, in line with other recent work on ﾓself-motivated agent behavior.ﾔ We demonstrate that the technique, despite being generically defined independently of scenario, performs quite well in relatively disparate scenarios, such as a Sokoban-inspired box-pushing scenario and in a Pac-Man-inspired predator game, suggesting novel and principle-based candidate routes toward more general game-playing algorithms.

96	Circuit Model of Magnetically-Insulated Induction Voltage Adders Based on the Transmission Line Code	Yixiang Hu; Fengju Sun; Jiangtao Zeng; Hao Wei; Jiahui Yin; Peitian Cong; Ai'ci Qiu	Plasma Science, IEEE Transactions on	20140807	Based on the transmission line code (TLCODE), a 1-D circuit model used for the analysis of magnetically-insulated induction voltage adders (MIVAs) was developed. Using cells improved from those of the JianGuang-I facility, a 10-stage MIVA was conceptually designed, and its equivalent TLCODE circuit model was described in detail with consideration of the magnetic insulation. To verify the effectiveness of this model, simulation results were compared with those of a PSPICE model (with no electron emission) under both synchronously triggering mode and ideal time-sequence triggering mode. The comparisons show that calculation results of these two models are accord with each other perfectly (within 0.1%). In addition, features of the calculation results were particularly analyzed and verified by the existent literatures. Considering the magnetic-insulation process, the inner stalk of the 10-stage MIVA was designed, and its output parameters were simulated with various electron emission thresholds (150, 200, and 250 kV/cm). Furthermore, qualitative analysis was done to present the model's abilities of the magnetic-insulation treatment.

97	Envelope Level Crossing Rate and Average Fade Duration of Nonisotropic Vehicle-to-Vehicle Ricean Fading Channels	Xiang Cheng; Cheng-Xiang Wang; Bo Ai; Aggoune, H.	Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20140130	This paper proposes a generic geometry-based stochastic model for nonisotropic scattering vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) Ricean fading channels. With the proposed model, the level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) are derived. The resultant expressions are sufficiently general and subsume many well-known existing LCRs and AFDs as special cases. The derived LCR and AFD are further investigated in terms of some important parameters, e.g., the shape of the scattering region (two-ring or ellipse), mean angle, angle spread, and directions of movement of the Tx and Rx (same or opposite direction). More importantly, in this paper, the impact of the vehicular traffic density on the LCR and AFD for nonisotropic scattering V2V Ricean fading channels is investigated for the first time. Excellent agreement is observed between the theoretical LCRs/AFDs and corresponding measured data, thus demonstrating the validity and utility of the proposed model.

98	Comparison of Microwave Backscatter Anisotropy Parameterizations of the Antarctic Ice Sheet Using ASCAT	Fraser, A.D.; Young, N.W.; Adams, N.	Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20131217	The C-band EUMETSAT Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) was launched in 2007, and provides backscatter measurements with excellent azimuth and incidence angle diversity in polar regions. C-band backscatter measurements can be used to retrieve near-surface snow/firn properties such as grain size and accumulation rate, however the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) exhibits strong microwave backscatter anisotropy as a function of both incidence and azimuth angles, and this anisotropy must be well understood before such physical parameter retrieval can be accurately performed. This paper presents a detailed comparison of several different parameterizations of both the azimuth and the incidence anisotropy. Parameterizations used here result in residuals similar to the radiometric performance of ASCAT, indicating accurate characterization of the anisotropy. The analysis of these parameterizations provides an insight into the physical mechanisms taking place near the surface of the AIS. 30-day composite maps of several parameters are presented, and discussed in the context of near-surface glaciology. This anisotropy characterization will form the basis of a technique for extraction of physical parameters of the AIS.

By change the sulfur content (x) in the TiO2/CdSxSe1-x nano-composites, it was observed that the light absorption edge can be gradually tuned within a broad wavelength from 540 to 710 nm. When used as photoanodes for hydrogen generation, the as-prepared TiO2/CdSxSe1-x NWAs show much higher photoelectroncatalytic activity than the pristine TiO2 NWAs. Moreover, the TiO2/CdSxSe1-x photoelectrode with x = 0.52 exhibited the highest photocurrent level and outstanding stability, which is more suitable for long-time hydrogen generation. This study may be useful in the design of alloy hetrostructure photoelectrodes with optimal chemical composition toward the more efficient solar conversion devices.

Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20141016	Synchronous island power systems, such as the combined Ireland and Northern Ireland power system, are facing increasing penetrations of renewable generation. As part of a wider suite of studies, performed in conjunction with the transmission system operators (TSOs) of the All-Island system (AIS), the frequency stability challenges at high and ultra-high wind penetrations were examined. The impact of both largest infeed loss and network fault induced wind turbine active power dips was examined: the latter contingency potentially representing a fundamental change in frequency stability risk. A system non-synchronous penetration (SNSP) ratio was defined to help identify system operational limits. A wide range of system conditions were studied, with results showing that measures such as altering ROCOF protection and enabling emulated inertia measures were most effective in reducing the frequency stability risk of a future Ireland system.

105	Self-Adaptation of Playing Strategies in General Game Playing	Swiechowski, M.; Mandziuk, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20141211	The term general game playing (GGP) refers to a subfield of AI which aims at developing agents able to effectively play many games from a particular class (finite, deterministic). It is also the name of the annual competition proposed by Stanford Logic Group at Stanford University (Stanford, CA, USA), which provides a framework for testing and evaluating GGP agents. In this paper, we present our GGP player which managed to win four out of seven games in the 2012 preliminary round and advanced to the final phase. Our system (named MINI-Player) relies on a pool of playing strategies and autonomously picks the ones which seem to be best suited to a given game. The chosen strategies are combined with one another and incorporated into the upper confidence bounds applied to trees (UCT) algorithm. The effectiveness of our player is evaluated on a set of games from the 2012 GGP Competition as well as a few other, single-player games. The paper discusses the efficacy of proposed playing strategies and evaluates the mechanism of their switching. The proposed idea of dynamically assigning search strategies during play is both novel and promising.

107	Susceptibility Assessment of Landslides Triggered by the Lushan Earthquake, April 20, 2013, China	Ruiqing Niu; Xueling Wu; Dengkui Yao; Ling Peng; Li Ai; Junhuan Peng	Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, IEEE Journal of	20141105	The Lushan earthquake ( Ms = 7.0; epicenter located at 30ﾰ17'N, 102ﾰ57'E) occurred on April 20, 2013 and had a focal depth of 12.3 km. The earthquake was triggered by the reactivation of the Longmenshan Fault in Lushan County, Sichuan Province, China. This earthquake caused massive landslides that resulted in tragic loss of life and economic devastation. Strong earthquakes are among the prime triggering factors of landslides. The zone of highest seismic intensity for this earthquake was selected as a case study to assess the susceptibility to earthquake-induced landslides. Visual interpretation of color aerial photographs with 0.4- and 0.6-m spatial resolution and extensive field surveys provided a detailed landslide inventory map that included 226 landslides. Nine primary landslide-related factors were selected as predictor variables, including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature classification, distance from drainages, slope structure, lithology, distance from faults, and peak ground acceleration. The support vector machine (SVM) is a popular learning procedure that is based on statistical learning theory and utilizes a kernel function to map data from the original feature space to a high-dimensional space. Using an SVM, a nonlinear landslide system can be converted into a linear landslide system. Two parameters C and mbi ? must be carefully predetermined to establish an efficient SVM. Therefore, a genetic algorithm (GA) was adopted to optimize the parameters of the SVM. The proposed GA-SVM model with the highest predictive accuracy and generalization ability was trained and then used to predict landslide susceptibility. The analytical results were validated by comparing them with known landslides using a success rate curve and classification accuracy. The GA-SVM model has an area ratio of 0.9586 and a kappa coefficient of 0.9575 and outperforms the SVM. Approximately, 94.97% of the landslides lie in the- very-high-susceptibility region, 2.17% of the landslides lie in the high-susceptibility region, 1.13% of the landslides lie in the moderate-susceptibility region, and 1.73% of the landslides lie in the low- and very-low-susceptibility regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the GA-SVM model provides the best predictive accuracy. The model can effectively assess landslide susceptibility and provides a novel method for landslide prediction.

109	Quality of service improvement for high-speed railway communications	Yuzhe, Zhou; Bo, Ai	Communications, China	20150107	With the fast development of highspeed railways, a call for fulfilling the notion of communication at ﾓanytime, anywhereﾔ for high-speed train passengers in the Train Operating Control System is on the way. In order to make a realization of that, new railway wireless communication networks are needed. The most promising one is the Long Term Evolution for Railway which will provide broadband access, fast handover, and reliable communication for high mobility users. However, with the increase of speed, the system is subjected to high bit error rate, Doppler frequency shift and handover failure just like other system does. This paper is trying to solve these problems by employing MIMO technique. Specifically, the goal is to provide higher data rate, higher reliability, less delay, and other relative quality of services for passengers. MIMO performance analysis, resource allocation, and access control for handover and various services in a two-hop model are proposed in this paper. Analytical results and simulation results show that the proposed model and schemes perform well in improving the system performances.

113	Propagation Measurements and Analysis for Train Stations of High-Speed Railway at 930 MHz	Ke Guan; Zhangdui Zhong; Bo Ai; Kurner, T.	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20141014	Train stations are one of the most common structures along a high-speed railway. They can block the line of sight (LOS), generate multiple reflected and scattered waves, and aggravate the fading behavior; however, these effects have been rarely investigated. This paper presents a group of 930-MHz measurements conducted on train stations of high-speed railways in China. The whole process of a train passing stations has been measured with two typical types of stations. The results indicate that, when the station is far from the transmitter (Tx), the semi-closed station (in which the awnings cover both the platforms and the rails) influences the propagation much more seriously than the open station (in which the awnings only cover the platforms supporting a clear free space over the tracks). When the station is near the Tx, the fact of whether the train keeps the LOS and stays inside the station determines the propagation for both types of stations. All the propagation characteristics, including extra propagation loss, shadow fading, small-scale fading, level crossing rate (LCR), average fade duration (AFD), and fading depth (FD), have been measured and computed for the first time. Specific findings of propagation characteristics in the train station scenario are provided. Afterward, by filling the gap of the train station scenario, a table is made to establish the comprehensive understanding of main scenarios in the high-speed railway. Furthermore, comparisons of the propagation characteristics between the train station scenario and ten standard scenarios are made to emphasize the significance of the modeling exclusively for the train station scenario. Finally, rules of the influence of four conditions are quantitatively revealed. The measured results and quantitative analysis are significant for leading the simulation and design of signaling and train control communications systems toward the reality.

115	Shall I Compare Thee to Another Story?ﾗAn Empirical Study of Analogy-Based Story Generation	Jichen Zhu; Ontanon, S.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	Despite their use in traditional storytelling, analogy-based narrative devices have not been sufficiently explored in computational narrative. In this paper, we present our analogy-based story generation (ASG) approach in the Riu system, focusing on analogical retrieval and projection. We report on an empirical user evaluation about Riu's capability to retrieve and generate short noninteractive stories using the story analogies through mapping (SAM) algorithm. This work provides the foundation for exploration of ASG in more complex and interactive computational narrative works.

116	Generation of full polarization in ferromagnetic graphene with spin energy gap	Wu, Qing-Ping; Liu, Zheng-Fang; Chen, Ai-Xi; Xiao, Xian-Bo; Liu, Zhi-Min	Applied Physics Letters	20141229	We propose a workable scheme for the generation of full spin polarization in ferromagnetic graphene system with strain or Rashba spin-orbit interaction. A spin energy gap can be opened in ferromagnetic graphene system in the presence of strain or Rashba spin-orbit interaction, leading to the full polarization in the spin energy gap. In addition, under the combined modulation of strain and Rashba spin-orbit interaction, the ferromagnetic graphene system can generate significantly large spin-polarized current with a full polarization in the spin energy gap. It is anticipated to apply such a phenomenon to design the electron spin devices based on the graphene.

118	A Neuroevolution Approach to General Atari Game Playing	Hausknecht, M.; Lehman, J.; Miikkulainen, R.; Stone, P.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20141211	This paper addresses the challenge of learning to play many different video games with little domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, it introduces a neuroevolution approach to general Atari 2600 game playing. Four neuroevolution algorithms were paired with three different state representations and evaluated on a set of 61 Atari games. The neuroevolution agents represent different points along the spectrum of algorithmic sophisticationﾗincluding weight evolution on topologically fixed neural networks (conventional neuroevolution), covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMAﾖES), neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT), and indirect network encoding (HyperNEAT). State representations include an object representation of the game screen, the raw pixels of the game screen, and seeded noise (a comparative baseline). Results indicate that direct-encoding methods work best on compact state representations while indirect-encoding methods (i.e., HyperNEAT) allow scaling to higher dimensional representations (i.e., the raw game screen). Previous approaches based on temporal-difference (TD) learning had trouble dealing with the large state spaces and sparse reward gradients often found in Atari games. Neuroevolution ameliorates these problems and evolved policies achieve state-of-the-art results, even surpassing human high scores on three games. These results suggest that neuroevolution is a promising approach to general video game playing (GVGP).

Control Theory & Applications, IET	20140619	This study describes how a very large number of deterministic input signals for system identification may be created by object-oriented methods. The concepts of aggregation and inheritance, combined with the properties of m-sequences, are utilised to develop two new methods for the creation of pseudorandom perturbation signals with ideal spectral properties, two, three, five or seven levels and a very wide range of periods. The available signal levels ensure that the signals are suitable for both linear and non-linear system identification and the availability of a large number of signal periods ensures that the signals are suitable for both single and multi-input system identification. The methods are described in detail and illustrated by examples, together with their implementation in the open environment of an efficient, user-friendly and freely available Matlab program which provides third-party software to complement existing Matlab Identification Toolboxes.	control engineering computing;identification;linear systems;m-sequences;nonlinear systems;object-oriented methods;signal processingMatlab identification toolbox;Matlab program;input signals;m-sequences;multiinput system identification;nonlinear system identification;object-oriented creation;object-oriented method;pseudorandom perturbation signal;signal level;signal periods;single system identification;spectral property;third-party software							
120	The role of a LiF layer on the performance of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/Si organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells	Zhang, Yunfang; Liu, Ruiyuan; Lee, Shuit-Tong; Sun, Baoquan	Applied Physics Letters	20140303	We report an ultra-thin layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) between silicon (Si) and aluminum (Al) in a Si/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hybrid solar cell which resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.09%. The insertion of a thin layer of LiF improved the contact between Si and Al, which decreased the contact resistance from 5.4 � 10?1 ? cm2 to 2.6 � 10?2 ? cm2. Also, the electron transport from Si to Al was improved and charge carrier recombination was suppressed. As a result, the short circuit current density, the open circuit voltage, and the fill factor were all improved with the presence of the LiF layer. The solar cell with the LiF/Al bilayer as a cathode displayed a 14.45% enhancement on PCE when compared with the device using pristine Al as a cathode.								
121	Personalized Interactive Narratives via Sequential Recommendation of Plot Points	Hong Yu; Riedl, M.O.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	In story-based games or other interactive systems, a drama manager (DM) is an omniscient agent that acts to bring about a particular sequence of plot points for the player to experience. Traditionally, the DM's narrative evaluation criteria are solely derived from a human designer. We present a DM that learns a model of the player's storytelling preferences and automatically recommends a narrative experience that is predicted to optimize the player's experience while conforming to the human designer's storytelling intentions. Our DM is also capable of manipulating the space of narrative trajectories such that the player is more likely to make choices that result in the recommended experience. Our DM uses a novel algorithm, called prefix-based collaborative filtering (PBCF), that solves the sequential recommendation problem to find a sequence of plot points that maximizes the player's rating of his or her experience. We evaluate our DM in an interactive storytelling environment based on choose-your-own-adventure novels. Our experiments show that our algorithms can improve the player's experience over the designer's storytelling intentions alone and can deliver more personalized experiences than other interactive narrative systems while preserving players' agency.

122	Preference Learning for Move Prediction and Evaluation Function Approximation in Othello	Runarsson, T.P.; Lucas, S.M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140911	This paper investigates the use of preference learning as an approach to move prediction and evaluation function approximation, using the game of Othello as a test domain. Using the same sets of features, we compare our approach with least squares temporal difference learning, direct classification, and with the Bradley-Terry model, fitted using minorization-maximization (MM). The results show that the exact way in which preference learning is applied is critical to achieving high performance. Best results were obtained using a combination of board inversion and pair-wise preference learning. This combination significantly outperformed the others under test, both in terms of move prediction accuracy, and in the level of play achieved when using the learned evaluation function as a move selector during game play.

124	Bidirectional Optimization of the Melting Spinning Process	Xiao Liang; Yongsheng Ding; Zidong Wang; Kuangrong Hao; Hone, K.; Huaping Wang	Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20140114	A bidirectional optimizing approach for the melting spinning process based on an immune-enhanced neural network is proposed. The proposed bidirectional model can not only reveal the internal nonlinear relationship between the process configuration and the quality indices of the fibers as final product, but also provide a tool for engineers to develop new fiber products with expected quality specifications. A neural network is taken as the basis for the bidirectional model, and an immune component is introduced to enlarge the searching scope of the solution field so that the neural network has a larger possibility to find the appropriate and reasonable solution, and the error of prediction can therefore be eliminated. The proposed intelligent model can also help to determine what kind of process configuration should be made in order to produce satisfactory fiber products. To make the proposed model practical to the manufacturing, a software platform is developed. Simulation results show that the proposed model can eliminate the approximation error raised by the neural network-based optimizing model, which is due to the extension of focusing scope by the artificial immune mechanism. Meanwhile, the proposed model with the corresponding software can conduct optimization in two directions, namely, the process optimization and category development, and the corresponding results outperform those with an ordinary neural network-based intelligent model. It is also proved that the proposed model has the potential to act as a valuable tool from which the engineers and decision makers of the spinning process could benefit.

125	On the Phase Compensation of Short ScanSAR Burst Focused by Long Matched Filter for Interferometric Processing	Cunren Liang; Qiming Zeng; Jian Jiao; Xi'ai Cui	Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20131212	Scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) uses a burst technique to image very large swaths and is widely used in spaceborne SARs. Many algorithms have been proposed to focus ScanSAR burst with its phase preserved so that the focused burst can be used in interferometry to acquire large scale geophysical information, such as land deformation and digital elevation model. However, nearly all of the algorithms leave the focused burst with an additional quadratic phase term that will affect subsequent interferometric processing in the case of short burst. With this phase term, the spectrum of the focused burst is altered according to the principle of stationary phase. Therefore, some processing, such as bandpass filtering, cannot produce desired results if routinely performed. To avoid the effects of the phase term and the nonstationary azimuth spectrum of the burst, a phase compensation scheme is suggested, combining with current focusing algorithms. Simulation experiments are designed to show the effects of the phase term on bandpass filtering. These effects are further verified by a few experiments using real SAR data in unsynchronized signal removal that is frequently required in repeat-pass ScanSAR interferometry. The new phase compensation scheme is tested in real SAR data experiments and works well.

126	Exponential Impedance-Transformer Stalks Used for Magnetically Insulated Induction Voltage Adders	Yixiang Hu; Fengju Sun; Jiangtao Zeng; Ai'ci Qiu; Hao Wei; Jiahui Yin; Peitian Cong	Plasma Science, IEEE Transactions on	20141106	An exponential impedance-transformer stalk was proposed for magnetically insulated induction voltage adders (MIVAs). Based on a 10-cell TLCODE model, performances of stalks with linear, stepped, and exponential profiles were quantified and analyzed as a function of m (the ratio of the adder output impedance to the one that is driver matched, m ? 1). Simulation results show that when m ? 1.5, stalks with the exponential profile result to the highest adder output voltages with a reverse voltage 7.5% of the dominative voltage, and the ? (the ratio of the subtraction between adder peak voltages with exponential and stepped profiles to the one with stepped profile) increases as the m goes up (when m = 5, ? is as much as 8%). Simulation results also indicate that with exponential impedance profile, the highest feeding voltage of the 10 cells is 2 MV when 1 ? m ? 10, and it always occurs at one of the last five cells. Moreover, it is found that with the exponential profile, the reverse coefficient ? (the maximum ratio of the reverse peak voltages to the nominal) is 9.5%.

127	Analysis of ReGEN as a Graph-Rewriting System for Quest Generation	Kybartas, B.; Verbrugge, C.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	Using procedural narrative generation in video games provides a flexible way to extend game play and provide more depth to the game world at low cost to the developers. Current examples of narrative generation in commercial games, however, tend to be simplistic, resulting in repetitive and uninteresting stories. In this paper, we develop a system for narrative generation using a context-aware graph-rewriting framework. We use a graph representation of the game world to create narratives which reflect and modify the current world state. Using a novel set of metrics to evaluate narrative quality, we validate our approach by comparing our generated narratives to other procedurally generated stories, as well as to authored narratives from commercially successful and critically praised games. The results show that our narratives compare favorably to the authored narratives. Our metrics provide a new approach to narrative analysis, and our system provides a unique and practical approach to story generation.

131	Optimal Viewing Angle Determination for Multiple Vessel Segments in Coronary Angiographic Image	Xuehu Wang; Jian Yang; Yang Chen; Danni Ai; Yining Hu; Yongtian Wang	Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	Angiographic image is the perspective projection of the whole body from a 3D space to a 2D imaging plane, in which X-ray is used. As such, topological vasculature information has been lost. In 2D angiograms, foreshortening and overlapping are commonly observed in tubular-like structures. Hence, an optimum viewing angle should be determined to observe an interesting vessel segment (IVS) or an interesting vessel bifurcation (IVB) with minimized foreshortening and overlapping from a limited number of angiographic images. In this study, a novel integrated optimization method is proposed to calculate the optimum viewing angle. In the proposed method, the irregular shape and inter-branch distance of vasculatures are considered. Furthermore, three optimized conditions, including projection foreshortening rate, projection stenosis rate, and projection overlapping rate, are designed and integrated to determine the optimum viewing angle in a single vessel segment. The three conditions, including projection foreshortening, projection stenosis, and projection adjacent spacing rates, are also designed to optimize the viewing angle of bifurcations. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we simulated an angiographic image based on X-ray propagating principle by integrating 3D coronary artery tree models and the respective CT volume data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective and robust; hence, this method can be used to determine the optimum viewing angle of IVS or IVB with irregular stenosis. The proposed method can also help physicians observe the branching structure or stenosis clearly in clinical practice.

132	A Micromanagement Task Allocation System for Real-Time Strategy Games	Rogers, K.D.; Skabar, A.A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140313	Real-time strategy (RTS) game play is a combination of strategy and micromanagement. While strategy is clearly important, the success of a strategy can depend greatly on effective micromanagement. Recent years have seen an increase in work focusing on micromanagement in RTS AI, but the great majority of these works have focused on policies for individual units or very specific situations, while very little work has aimed to address the need for a broadly applicable structure for unit group coordination. This paper conceptualizes RTS group level micromanagement as a multiagent task allocation (TA) problem, and proposes the micromanagement task allocation system (MTAS) as a framework to bridge the gap between strategy and unit level micromanagement. MTAS fits into the common layered RTS AI structure, and can thus, in principle, be integrated into any existing system based on this layered structure. We describe the integration of MTAS into E323AI (an existing AI player for the spring RTS engine), and provide empirical results demonstrating that MTAS leads to statistically significant improvement in performance on the popular RTS game Balanced Annihilation.

134	A Computational Model of Plan-Based Narrative Conflict at the Fabula Level	Ware, S.G.; Young, R.M.; Harrison, B.; Roberts, D.L.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140911	Conflict is an essential element of interesting stories. In this paper, we operationalize a narratological definition of conflict and extend established narrative planning techniques to incorporate this definition. The conflict partial order causal link planning algorithm (CPOCL) allows narrative conflict to arise in a plan while maintaining causal soundness and character believability. We also define seven dimensions of conflict in terms of this algorithm's knowledge representation. The first three-participants, reason, and duration-are discrete values which answer the ﾓwho?ﾔ ﾓwhy?ﾔ and ﾓwhen?ﾔ questions, respectively. The last four-balance, directness, stakes, and resolution-are continuous values which describe important narrative properties that can be used to select conflicts based on the author's purpose. We also present the results of two empirical studies which validate our operationalizations of these narrative phenomena. Finally, we demonstrate the different kinds of stories which CPOCL can produce based on constraints on the seven dimensions.

135	Precise VLSI Architecture for AI Based 1-D/ 2-D Daub-6 Wavelet Filter Banks With Low Adder-Count	Madishetty, S.K.; Madanayake, A.; Cintra, R.J.; Dimitrov, V.S.	Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, IEEE Transactions on	20140624	A multiplier-less architecture based on algebraic integer representation for computing the Daubechies 6-tap wavelet transform for 1-D/2-D signal processing is proposed. This architecture improves on previous designs in a sense that it minimizes the number of parallel 2-input adder circuits. The algorithm was achieved using brute-force numerical optimization of the algebraic integer representation. The proposed architecture furnishes exact computation up to the final reconstruction step, which is the operation that maps the exactly computed filtered results from algebraic integer representation to fixed-point. Compared to our recent work, this architecture shows a reduction of 27ﾷn-16 adder circuits, where n is the number of wavelet decomposition levels. The design is physically implemented for a 4-level 1-D/2-D decomposition using a Xilinx Virtex-6 vcx240t-1ff1156 field programmable gate array (FPGA) device operating at up to a maximum clock frequency of 344/ 168 MHz. The FPGA implementation of 1-D/2-D are tested using hardware co-simulation using an ML605 board with clock of 100 MHz. A 45 nm CMOS synthesis of 2-D designs show improved clock frequency of better than 306 MHz for a supply voltage of 1.1 V.

136	Research on size and location of distributed generation with vulnerable node identification in the active distribution network	Yuanyuan Zhao; Yiran An; Qian Ai	Generation, Transmission & Distribution, IET	20141103	This study aims to solve for the optimal location and capacity of distributed generation (DG), taking vulnerable node identification into consideration, in active distribution networks (ADN). Vulnerable nodes exist in the distribution network. Considering that the power fluctuations of those vulnerable nodes will have a significant impact on other nodes, the allocations of the DGs should avoid such nodes. Therefore vulnerable node identification and removal from the network can greatly limit the siting range of DGs. In this study, the vulnerable nodes are identified based on the small-world network theory, which is used as the preliminary location of the DG. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to finally address the optimal location and capacity for grid-connected DG. A GA with voltage boundary constraints is utilised to effectively prevent the bus voltage from reaching its boundary. This method improves the calculation efficiency greatly and is therefore suitable for flexible distribution network topology in ADN. According to the change of the distribution network topology, the corresponding optimal location and capacity limit for the DG can be quickly calculated. Some examples validate the algorithm and prove that it has fast convergence.	distributed power generation;distribution networks;fault diagnosis;genetic algorithmsADN;DG;active distribution network;calculation efflciency;capacity limit;convergence;distributed generation;flexible distribution network topology;genetic algorithm;grid-connected DG;optimal location;power fluctuations;small-world network theory;voltage boundary constraints;vulnerable node identification							
137	Procedural Generation of Dungeons	van der Linden, R.; Lopes, R.; Bidarra, R.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140313	The use of procedural content generation (PCG) techniques in game development has been mostly restricted to very specific types of game elements. PCG has seldom been deployed for generating entire game levels, a notable exception to this being dungeons: a specific type of game level often encountered in adventure and role playing games. Due to their peculiar combination of pace, gameplay, and game spaces, dungeon levels are among the most suited to showcase the benefits of PCG. This paper surveys research on procedural methods to generate dungeon game levels. We summarize common practices, discuss pros and cons of different approaches, and identify a few promising challenges ahead. In general, what current procedural dungeon generation methods are missing is not performance, but more powerful, accurate, and richer control over the generation process. Recent research results seem to indicate that gameplay-related criteria can provide this high-level control. However, this area is still in its infancy, and many research challenges still lie ahead, e.g., improving the intuitiveness and accessibility of such methods for designers. We also observe that more research is needed into generic mechanisms for automating the generation of the actual dungeon-geometric models.

138	Captcha as Graphical PasswordsﾗA New Security Primitive Based on Hard AI Problems	Zhu, B.B.; Yan, J.; Guanbo Bao; Maowei Yang; Ning Xu	Information Forensics and Security, IEEE Transactions on	20140422	Many security primitives are based on hard mathematical problems. Using hard AI problems for security is emerging as an exciting new paradigm, but has been under-explored. In this paper, we present a new security primitive based on hard AI problems, namely, a novel family of graphical password systems built on top of Captcha technology, which we call Captcha as graphical passwords (CaRP). CaRP is both a Captcha and a graphical password scheme. CaRP addresses a number of security problems altogether, such as online guessing attacks, relay attacks, and, if combined with dual-view technologies, shoulder-surfing attacks. Notably, a CaRP password can be found only probabilistically by automatic online guessing attacks even if the password is in the search set. CaRP also offers a novel approach to address the well-known image hotspot problem in popular graphical password systems, such as PassPoints, that often leads to weak password choices. CaRP is not a panacea, but it offers reasonable security and usability and appears to fit well with some practical applications for improving online security.

139	A 0.002-mm   6.4-mW 10-Gb/s Full-Rate Direct DFE Receiver With 59.6% Horizontal Eye Opening Under 23.3-dB Channel Loss at Nyquist Frequency	Yong Chen; Mak, P.-I.; Li Zhang; Yan Wang	Microwave Theory and Techniques, IEEE Transactions on	20141202	This paper reports a full-rate direct decision-feedback-equalization (DFE) receiver with circuit techniques to widen the data eye opening with competitive power and area efficiencies. Specifically, a current-reuse active-inductor (AI) linear equalizer is merged into a clocked-one-tap DFE core for joint-elimination of pre-cursor and long-tail post-cursors. Unlike the passive-inductor designs that are bulky and untunable, the AI linear equalizer offers orthogonally tunable low- and high-frequency de-emphasis. The clocked-one-tap DFE resolves the first post-cursor via return-to-zero feedback data patterns for sharper data transition (i.e., horizontal eye opening), and is followed by a D-flip-flop slicer to maximize the data height (i.e., vertical eye opening). A 10-Gb/s DFE receiver was fabricated in 65-nm CMOS. Measured over an 84-cm printed circuit board differential trace with 23.3-dB channel loss at Nyquist frequency (5 GHz), the achieved figure-of-merit is 0.027 pJ/bit/dB (power consumption/date rate/channel loss). At 10-12 bit error rate under 27-1 pseudorandom binary sequence, the horizontal and vertical eye opening are 59.6% and 189.3 mV, respectively. The die size is 0.002 mm2.

By virtue of the highly nonlinear effect of microfiber-based GSA, the multipulse formation, such as the soliton molecule, is greatly enhanced despite of the all-normal dispersion regime. Depending on the cavity parameter selections, it was found that the conventional multisoliton could be reconstructed and then evolve into the soliton molecule. The soliton molecule trapping of two polarization components with a 0.65-nm wavelength separation was observed, which propagated as a group-velocity locked vector soliton despite of the cavity birefringence. The obtained results provide an enhanced understanding of dynamics of the soliton molecule.

143	GAMYGDALA: An Emotion Engine for Games	Popescu, A.; Broekens, J.; van Someren, M.	Affective Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20140508	In this paper we present GAMYGDALA, an emotional appraisal engine that enables game developers to easily add emotions to their Non-Player Characters (NPC). Our approach proposes a solution that is positioned between event coding of affect, where individual events have predetermined annotated emotional consequences for NPCs, and a full blown cognitive appraisal model. Instead, for an NPC that needs emotions the game developer defines goals and annotates game events with a relation to these goals. Based on this input, GAMYGDALA produces an emotion for that NPC according to the well-known OCC model. In this paper we provide evidence for the following: GAMYGDALA provides black-box Game-AI independent emotion support, is efficient for large numbers of NPCs, and is psychologically grounded.

145	Photon assisted tunneling through three quantum dots with spin-orbit-coupling	Tang, Han-Zhao; An, Xing-Tao; Wang, Ai-Kun; Liu, Jian-Jun	Journal of Applied Physics	20140814	The effect of an ac electric field on quantum transport properties in a system of three quantum dots, two of which are connected in parallel, while the third is coupled to one of the other two, is investigated theoretically. Based on the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function method, the spin-dependent current, occupation number, and spin accumulation can be obtained in our model. An external magnetic flux, Rashba spin-orbit-coupling (SOC), and intradot Coulomb interactions are considered. The magnitude of the spin-dependent average current and the positions of the photon assisted tunneling (PAT) peaks can be accurately controlled and manipulated by simply varying the strength of the coupling and the frequency of the ac field. A particularly interesting result is the observation of a new kind of PAT peak and a multiple-PAT effect that can be generated and controlled by the coupling between the quantum dots. In addition, the spin occupation number and spin accumulation can be well controlled by the Rashba SOC and the magnetic flux.								
146	Plasmonic enhancement in hybrid organic/Si heterojunction solar cells enabled by embedded gold nanoparticles	Xia, Zhouhui; Song, Tao; Sun, Jun; Lee, Shuit-Tong; Sun, Baoquan	Applied Physics Letters	20141222	We investigate the incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrenesulfonate for organic/Si heterojunction hybrid solar cells. The incorporation of Au NPs can enhance the short-circuit current density (Jsc), consequently, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). The hybrid devices incorporating Au NPs with optimized size achieve a PCE of over 12.9% with about 10% enhancement of the Jsc compared with that of reference ones. Au NPs with different sizes are incorporated to explore the mechanism for the enhanced device performance. According to the detailed experimental characterization and numerical simulation results, the increased PCE is attributed to the light scattering and the local electromagnetic field enhancement, which is originated from the excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs.								
147	Ultrafast single-electron transfer in coupled quantum dots driven by a few-cycle chirped pulse	Yang, Wen-Xing; Chen, Ai-Xi; Bai, Yanfeng; Lee, Ray-Kuang	Journal of Applied Physics	20140414	We theoretically study the ultrafast transfer of a single electron between the ground states of a coupled double quantum dot (QD) structure driven by a nonlinear chirped few-cycle laser pulse. A time-dependent Schr�dinger equation without the rotating wave approximation is solved numerically. We demonstrate numerically the possibility to have a complete transfer of a single electron by choosing appropriate values of chirped rate parameters and the intensity of the pulse. Even in the presence of the spontaneous emission and dephasing processes of the QD system, high-efficiency coherent transfer of a single electron can be obtained in a wide range of the pulse parameters. Our results illustrate the potential to utilize few-cycle pulses for the excitation in coupled quantum dot systems through the nonlinear chirp parameter control, as well as a guidance in the design of experimental implementation.								
148	Enhanced performance for polymer/fullerene solar cells by using bromobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane co-solvent	Huang, Xiaodong; Peng, Jun; Lu, Kunyuan; Liu, Zeke; Wu, Zhongwei; Yuan, Jianyu; Lu, Jialing; Wang, Hai-Qiao; Ma, Wanli	Applied Physics Letters	20140602	Bromobenzene and iodobenzene with/without additive 1,8-diiodooctane were investigated as the alternative solvents for the widely used chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane in polymer/fullerene solar cells. The P3HT/[6,6]-phenylC61-butyric acid methyl ester devices using bromobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane co-solvent have achieved significantly better performance than those using conventional chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane, which is attributed to the enhanced diode characteristics, higher charge-carrier mobility, and the improved morphology. More importantly, the bromobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane system has also demonstrated improved performance for other polymer/fullerene composites. Thus, we conclude that, with appropriate boiling point, intriguing solubility for active materials, and good compatibility with 1,8-diiodooctane, bromobenzene can be an excellent alternative solvent used for some polymer/fullerene systems in polymer/fullerene solar cells.								
149	Novel 3D Geometry-Based Stochastic Models for Non-Isotropic MIMO Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channels	Yi Yuan; Cheng-Xiang Wang; Xiang Cheng; Bo Ai; Laurenson, D.I.	Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20140124	This paper proposes a novel three-dimensional (3D) theoretical regular-shaped geometry-based stochastic model (RS-GBSM) and the corresponding sum-of-sinusoids (SoS) simulation model for non-isotropic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) Ricean fading channels. The proposed RS-GBSM, combining line-of-sight (LoS) components, a two-sphere model, and an elliptic-cylinder model, has the ability to study the impact of the vehicular traffic density (VTD) on channel statistics, and jointly considers the azimuth and elevation angles by using the von Mises Fisher distribution. Moreover, a novel parameter computation method is proposed for jointly calculating the azimuth and elevation angles in the SoS channel simulator. Based on the proposed 3D theoretical RS-GBSM and its SoS simulation model, statistical properties are derived and thoroughly investigated. The impact of the elevation angle in the 3D model on key statistical properties is investigated by comparing with those of the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) model. It is demonstrated that the 3D model is more accurate to characterize real V2V channels, in particular for pico cell scenarios. Finally, close agreement is achieved between the theoretical model, SoS simulation model, and simulation results, demonstrating the utility of the proposed models.	3D RS-GBSM;MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle channels;non-isotropic scattering;statistical properties;vehicular traffic density,Azimuth;Computational modeling;MIMO;Narrowband;Solid modeling;Stochastic processes;Three-dimensional displays,MIMO communication;Rician channels;statistical analysis;stochastic processes3D model;LoS components;SoS simulation model;VTD;channel statistics;elevation angle;elliptic-cylinder model;line-of-sight components;nonisotropic MIMO vehicle-to-vehicle Ricean fading channels;nonisotropic multiple-input multiple-output V2V Ricean fading channels;novel 3D regular-shaped geometry-based stochastic model;novel parameter computation method;pico cell scenarios;real V2V channels;statistical properties;sum-of-sinusoids simulation model;three-dimensional theoretical RS-GBSM;two-sphere model;vehicular traffic density;von Mises Fisher distribution							
150	A Supervised Learning Framework for Modeling Director Agent Strategies in Educational Interactive Narrative	Lee, S.Y.; Rowe, J.P.; Mott, B.W.; Lester, J.C.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	Computational models of interactive narrative offer significant potential for creating educational game experiences that are procedurally tailored to individual players and support learning. A key challenge posed by interactive narrative is devising effective director agent models that dynamically sequence story events according to players' actions and needs. In this paper, we describe a supervised machine-learning framework to model director agent strategies in an educational interactive narrative Crystal Island. Findings from two studies with human participants are reported. The first study utilized a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm where human ﾓwizardsﾔ directed participants through Crystal Island's mystery storyline by dynamically controlling narrative events in the game environment. Interaction logs yielded training data for machine learning the conditional probabilities of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model of the human wizards' directorial actions. Results indicate that the DBN model achieved significantly higher precision and recall than naive Bayes and bigram model techniques. In the second study, the DBN director agent model was incorporated into the runtime version of Crystal Island, and its impact on students' narrative-centered learning experiences was investigated. Results indicate that machine-learning director agent strategies from human demonstrations yield models that positively shape players' narrative-centered learning and problem-solving experiences.

151	Designing User-Character Dialog in Interactive Narratives: An Exploratory Experiment	Endrass, B.; Klimmt, C.; Mehlmann, G.; Andre, E.; Roth, C.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	Through interaction with the virtual environment and virtual characters, users are able to influence the storyline of many games. The design choice for the style of interactivity can thereby have a crucial influence on the user's experience. However, only a few approaches evaluate different interaction modalities for one system to investigate the impact of design choice on the users' experience. In this paper, we present an experimental approach in which we first reflect on design alternatives concerning a specific element of interactive narratives-user-character dialog-and then investigate user responses to different design options (round-based dialog versus continuous dialog). Results of an experimental evaluation study show that users tend to prefer continuous interaction in a soap-opera-like game environment using typed text input to communicate with virtual characters that act and react using speech output, although the recognition rate of user utterances of the continuous version was slightly worse compared to the round-based version.

152	A Model of Human Activity Automatization as a Basis of Artificial Intelligence Systems	Bielecki, A.	Autonomous Mental Development, IEEE Transactions on	20140909	In this paper, a human activity automatization phenomenon is analyzed as a process as a result of which a cognitive structure is replaced by the equivalent reflexive structure. Such replacement plays an essential role as a mechanism that optimizes human mental processes according to their energetic and time consuming aspects. The main goal of the studies described in this paper is working out the algorithm that enables us to create the analogous mechanism in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The solution would enable us to use in real time systems such AI systems, that, so far, could not have been used due to their high time consumption. The information metabolism theory (IMT) is the basis for the analysis. A cybernetic model of automatization, based on IMT, is introduced. There have been specified conditions according to which such solution is profitable. An automatization-type mechanism has been applied to IP traffic scanner and to a mutiagent system. As a result, time and memory properties of the systems have been improved significantly.

153	Integrated source of tunable nonmaximally mode-entangled photons in a domain-engineered lithium niobate waveguide	Ming, Yang; Wu, Zi-jian; Cui, Guo-xin; Tan, Ai-hong; Xu, Fei; Lu, Yan-qing	Applied Physics Letters	20140505	The nonmaximally entangled state is a special kind of entangled state, which has important applications in quantum information processing. It has been generated in quantum circuits based on bulk optical elements. However, corresponding schemes in integrated quantum circuits have been rarely considered. In this Letter, we propose an effective solution for this problem. An electro-optically tunable nonmaximally mode-entangled photon state is generated in an on-chip domain-engineered lithium niobate (LN) waveguide. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion and electro-optic interaction are effectively combined through suitable domain design to transform the entangled state into our desired formation. Moreover, this is a flexible approach to entanglement architectures. Other kinds of reconfigurable entanglements are also achievable through this method. LN provides a very promising platform for future quantum circuit integration.

New features and techniques have been developed in both the architecture and the analog modules to meet the jitter and protocol requirements for a redriver for multi-Gb/s operation, which is made difficult by the lack of CDR and a PLL. These techniques include: 1) adaptive receiver equalization; 2) enhanced transmitter output swing and programmable de-emphasis/swing settings; 3) a robust state flow control combined with various signal detectors to provide automatic state and mode switching without affecting operations of upstream and downstream ports.

155	Vehicle-to-Vehicle Propagation Models With Large Vehicle Obstructions	Ruisi He; Molisch, A.F.; Tufvesson, F.; Zhangdui Zhong; Bo Ai; Tingting Zhang	Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20140925	Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is an enabler for improved traffic safety and congestion control. As for any wireless system, the ultimate performance limit is determined by the propagation channel. A particular point of interest is the shadowing effect of large vehicles such as trucks and buses, as this might affect the communication range significantly. In this paper we present measurement results and model the propagation channel, in which a bus acts either as a shadowing object or as a relay between two passenger cars. The measurement setup is based on a Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) software radio as transmitter and a Tektronix RSA5106A real-time complex spectrum analyzer as receiver. We analyze the influence of the bus location and car separation distance on the path loss, shadowing, small-scale fading, delay spread, and cross correlation. The main effect of the bus is that it is acting as an obstruction creating an additional 15- to 20-dB attenuation and an increase in the root-mean-square delay spread by roughly 100 ns. A Nakagami distribution is found to well describe the statistics of the small-scale fading, by using Akaike's Information Criterion and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The distance dependence of the path loss is analyzed and a stochastic model is developed.

A typical offshore windfarm may have hundreds of generators, which is outspread in the range of several to tens of kilometers. Therefore, there are many feasible schemes for the wind turbine location and internal line connection in a wind farm. The planner must search for an optimal one from these feasible schemes, usually with a maximum wind power output and the lowest installation and operation cost. This paper proposes a novel procedure to determine the optimization wind turbine location and line connection topology by using artificial intelligence techniques: The genetic algorithm is utilized in the optimal layouts for the offshore wind farm, and the ant colony system algorithm is utilized to find the optimal line connection topology. Furthermore, the wake effect, real cable parameters, and wind speed series are also considered in this research. The concepts and methods proposed in this study could help establish more economical and efficient offshore wind farms in the world.

158	Improvement of power transformer insulation diagnosis using oil characteristics data preprocessed by SMOTEBoost technique	Yi Cui; Hui Ma; Saha, T.	Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, IEEE Transactions on	20141023	"This paper proposes a novel method for power transformer insulation assessment using oil characteristics. A hybrid algorithm, named as SMOTEBoost is implemented in the paper to improve the diagnosis accuracy and consistency. The SMOTEBoost can significantly enhance the generalization capability of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for transformer insulation diagnosis. This will provide important benefits for applying AI techniques in utility companies, i.e., an AI algorithm with its model built upon on a ""local"" dataset can be utilized ""globally"" to make transformer insulation diagnosis. The SMOTEBoost adopts Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle the class imbalance problem, in which data points belonging to different fault types or insulation conditions are unevenly distributed in the training dataset. By using this boosting approach for reweighting and grouping data points in the training dataset, the SMOTEBoost facilitates AI algorithms consistently attaining desirable diagnosis accuracy. To verify the advantages of SMOTEBoost algorithm, it is integrated with a number of representative AI algorithms including support vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree, radial basis function (RBF) network and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) to make transformer insulation diagnosis using various oil characteristic datasets collected from different utility companies. A statistical performance comparison amongst these algorithms is presented in the paper."

159	Long-Term Wind Speed Forecasting and General Pattern Recognition Using Neural Networks	Azad, H.B.; Mekhilef, S.; Ganapathy, V.G.	Sustainable Energy, IEEE Transactions on	20140318	Long-term forecasting of wind speed has become a research hot spot in many different areas such as restructured electricity markets, energy management, and wind farm optimal design. However, wind energy with unstable and intermittent characteristics entails establishing accurate predicted data to avoid inefficient and less reliable results. The proposed study in this paper may provide a solution regarding the long-term wind speed forecast in order to solve the earlier-mentioned problems. For this purpose, two fundamentally different approaches, the statistical and the neural network-based approaches, have been developed to predict hourly wind speed data of the subsequent year. The novelty of this study is to forecast the general trend of the incoming year by designing a data fusion algorithm through several neural networks. A set of recent wind speed measurement samples from two meteorological stations in Malaysia, namely Kuala Terengganu and Mersing, are used to train and test the data set. The result obtained by the proposed method has given rather promising results in view of the very small mean absolute error (MAE).

161	Generation of Multiwavelength Noise-Like Square-Pulses in a Fiber Laser	Hao Liu; Xu-Wu Zheng; Nian Zhao; Qiu-Yi Ning; Meng Liu; Zhi-Chao Luo; Ai-Ping Luo; Wen-Cheng Xu	Photonics Technology Letters, IEEE	20140908	The generation of multiwavelength square pulses is demonstrated in a passively mode-locked figure-eight fiber laser. The multiwavelength square pulses were found to be structured by superposing the square pulses centered at different wavelengths, whose pulse duration broadens with the increasing pump power. The square pulse was confirmed as the noise-like pulse by using an autocorrelator. By properly rotating the PCs, the dual- or triple-wavelength square pulse could be achieved. The obtained results provide a new viewpoint for understanding the formation mechanism of the multiwavelength pulses with noise-like square profiles in fiber lasers.

162	An Extensible Description Language for Video Games	Schaul, T.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20141211	In this short paper, we propose a powerful new tool for conducting research on computational intelligence and games. ﾓPyVGDLﾔ is a simple, high-level, extensible description language for 2-D video games. It is based on defining locations and dynamics for simple building blocks (objects), together with local interaction effects. A rich ontology defines various controllers, object behaviors, passive effects (physics), and collision effects. It can be used to quickly design games, without having to deal with control structures. We show how the dynamics of many classical games can be generated from a few lines of PyVGDL. Furthermore, the accompanying software library permits parsing and instantly playing those games, visualized from a bird's-eye or first-person viewpoint, and using them as benchmarks for learning algorithms.

163	A Computational Model of Narrative Generation for Surprise Arousal	Byung-Chull Bae; Young, R.M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	This paper describes our effort for a planning-based computational model of narrative generation that is designed to elicit surprise in the reader's mind, making use of two temporal narrative devices: flashback and foreshadowing. In our computational model, flashback provides a backstory to explain what causes a surprising outcome, while foreshadowing gives hints about the surprise before it occurs. Here, we present Prevoyant, a planning-based computational model of surprise arousal in narrative generation, and analyze the effectiveness of Prevoyant. The work here also presents a methodology to evaluate surprise in narrative generation using a planning-based approach based on the cognitive model of surprise causes. The results of the experiments that we conducted show strong support that Prevoyant effectively generates a discourse structure for surprise arousal in narrative.

164	Development and Specification of a Reference Architecture for Agent-Based Systems	Regli, W.C.; Mayk, I.; Cannon, C.T.; Kopena, J.B.; Lass, R.N.; Mongan, W.M.; Nguyen, D.N.; Salvage, J.K.; Sultanik, E.A.; Usbeck, K.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20140114	The recent growth of agent-based software systems was achieved without the development of a reference architecture. From a software engineering standpoint, a reference architecture is necessary to compare, evaluate, and integrate past, current, and future agent-based software systems. The agent systems reference architecture (ASRA) advances the agent-based system development process by providing a set of key interaction patterns for functional areas that exist between the layers and protocols of agent-based systems. Furthermore, the ASRA identifies the points for interoperability between agent-based systems and increases the level of discussion when referring to agent-based systems. This paper presents methodology, grounded in software forensics, to develop the ASRA and provides an overview of the resulting architectural representation. The methodology uses an approach based on software engineering techniques adapted to study agent frameworks-the libraries and tools for building agent systems. The resulting ASRA can serve as an abstract representation of the components necessary for facilitating comparison, integration, and interoperation of software systems composed of agents.

165	Path Loss Modeling for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication on a Slope	Pengyu Liu; Matolak, D.W.; Bo Ai; Ruoyu Sun	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20140710	Path loss modeling for both regular and irregular terrains is still gaining significant attention from researchers. A sloped terrain is one specific kind of an irregular terrain that-as far as we are aware-has not been completely studied. Although some results have been published for slope path loss modeling in cellular communication, an adequate model for the case when the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) both have low-height antennas and are located on or near a slope does not exist. In this paper, for complete analysis of such conditions, we consider four scenarios: 1) two vehicles are located at opposite ends of the slope; 2) one vehicle is on the slope, and the other vehicle is beyond the slope crest; 3) one vehicle is on the slope, and the other is away from the slope at the bottom; 4) both vehicles are on the slope. For scenarios 1 and 2, we have developed analytical path loss models. We have also made some corroborating measurements for scenario 1. Scenarios 3 and 4 are addressed by models already in the literature. Simulation results for two vehicles traveling toward, on, and then beyond a slope (a sequence of our scenarios) are also shown to illustrate how sloped-terrain path loss varies in contrast to the typical flat-earth condition. Our models for scenarios 1 and 2 add to the literature and can be used to numerically estimate path losses for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication over a slope.

166	Simultaneous Measurement of Temperature and Curvature Based on Hollow Annular Core Fiber	Yaxun Zhang; Ai Zhou; Boyang Qin; Quan Xu; Zhihai Liu; Jun Yang; Libo Yuan	Photonics Technology Letters, IEEE	20140430	We propose a simultaneous temperature and curvature sensor based on a hollow annular core fiber (HACF) Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The MZI is fabricated by inserting a short section of HACF between two short pieces of multimode fibers, and interference occurs between the light beams transmitting along the air hole and annular core of the HACF. Curvature and temperature can be measured through fringe visibility variation and wavelength shift of the interference spectrum, respectively. The experimental results show that the temperature sensitivity is 30 pm/ﾰC in the range of 30ﾰC-100ﾰC, and the maximum visibility variation is 32.4 dB from 0.555 to 5.405 m-1. In addition, the device is insensitive to external refractive index.

167	Parylene-based active micro space radiator with thermal contact switch	Ueno, Ai; Suzuki, Yuji	Applied Physics Letters	20140310	Thermal management is crucial for highly functional spacecrafts exposed to large fluctuations of internal heat dissipation and/or thermal boundary conditions. Since thermal radiation is the only means for heat removal, effective control of radiation is required for advanced space missions. In the present study, a MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) active radiator using the contact resistance change has been proposed. Unlike previous bulky thermal louvers/shutters, higher fill factor can be accomplished with an array of electrostatically driven micro diaphragms suspended with polymer tethers. With an early prototype developed with parylene MEMS technologies, radiation heat flux enhancement up to 42% has been achieved.

169	Propagation Measurements and Modeling of Crossing Bridges on High-Speed Railway at 930 MHz	Ke Guan; Zhangdui Zhong; Bo Ai; Kurner, T.	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20140212	Bridges that cross a railway's right-of-way are one of the most common obstacles for wave propagation along a highspeed railway. They can lead to poor coverage or handover failure but have been rarely investigated before. To describe the influence of this nonnegligible structure on propagation, measurements have been taken at 930 MHz along a real high-speed railway in China. Based on different mechanisms, the entire propagation process is presented by four zones in the case of an independent crossing bridge (ICB) and two zones in the case of groups of crossing bridges. First, all the propagation characteristics, including extra propagation loss, shadow fading, small-scale fading, and fading depth, have been measured and extracted. The results are shown in a complete table for accurate statistical modeling. Then, two empirical models, i.e., ICB and crossing bridges group (CBG), are first established to describe the extra loss owing to the crossing bridges. The proposed models improve on the state-of-the-art models for this problem, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.0 and 3.7 dB, respectively.

170	Multimodal Similarity-Preserving Hashing	Masci, J.; Bronstein, M.M.; Bronstein, A.M.; Schmidhuber, J.	Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on	20140324	We introduce an efficient computational framework for hashing data belonging to multiple modalities into a single representation space where they become mutually comparable. The proposed approach is based on a novel coupled siamese neural network architecture and allows unified treatment of intra- and inter-modality similarity learning. Unlike existing cross-modality similarity learning approaches, our hashing functions are not limited to binarized linear projections and can assume arbitrarily complex forms. We show experimentally that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing approaches on multimedia retrieval tasks.

172	Microfiber-based gold nanorods as saturable absorber for femtosecond pulse generation in a fiber laser	Wang, Xu-De; Luo, Zhi-Chao; Liu, Hao; Liu, Meng; Luo, Ai-Ping; Xu, Wen-Cheng	Applied Physics Letters	20141023	We reported on the femtosecond pulse generation from an erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser by using microfiber-based gold nanorods (GNRs) as saturable absorber (SA). By virtue of the geometric characteristic of microfiber-based GNRs, the optical damage threshold of GNRs-SA could be greatly enhanced. The microfiber-based GNRs-SA shows a modulation depth of 4.9% and a nonsaturable loss of 21.1%. With the proposed GNRs-SA, the fiber laser emitted a mode-locked pulse train with duration of ?887 fs. The obtained results demonstrated that the GNRs deposited microfiber could indeed serve as a high-performance SA towards the practical applications in the field of ultrafast photonics.								
173	Temperature-sensitive junction transformations for mid-wavelength HgCdTe photovoltaic infrared detector arrays by laser beam induced current microscope	Qiu, WeiCheng; Hu, Weida; Lin, Tie; Cheng, Xiang'ai; Wang, Rui; Yin, Fei; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Xiaoshuang; Lu, Wei	Applied Physics Letters	20141113	In this paper, we report on the disappearance of the photosensitive area extension effect and the unusual temperature dependence of junction transformation for mid-wavelength, n-on-p HgCdTe photovoltaic infrared detector arrays. The n-type region is formed by B+ ion implantation on Hg-vacancy-doped p-type HgCdTe. Junction transformations under different temperatures are visually captured by a laser beam induced current microscope. A physical model of temperature dependence on junction transformation is proposed and demonstrated by using numerical simulations. It is shown that Hg-interstitial diffusion and temperature activated defects jointly lead to the p-n junction transformation dependence on temperature, and the weaker mixed conduction compared with long-wavelength HgCdTe photodiode contributes to the disappearance of the photosensitive area extension effect in mid-wavelength HgCdTe infrared detector arrays.								
174	VersuﾗA Simulationist Storytelling System	Evans, R.; Short, E.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20140612	Versu is a text-based simulationist interactive drama. Because it uses autonomous agents, the drama is highly replayable: you can play the same story from multiple perspectives, or assign different characters to the various roles. The architecture relies on the notion of a social practice to achieve coordination between the independent autonomous agents. A social practice describes a recurring social situation, and is a successor to the Schankian script. Social practices are implemented as reactive joint plans, providing affordances to the agents who participate in them. The practices never control the agents directly; they merely provide suggestions. It is always the individual agent who decides what to do, using utility-based reactive action selection.

175	Vectorial Bent Functions From Multiple Terms Trace Functions	Muratovic-Ribic, A.; Pasalic, E.; Bajric, S.	Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on	20140116	In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a function of the form F(x)=Trk2k(?i=1taixri(2k-1)) to be bent. Three equivalent statements, all of them providing both the necessary and sufficient conditions, are derived. In particular, one characterization provides an interesting link between the bentness and the evaluation of F on the cyclic group of the (2k+1)th primitive roots of unity in GF(22k). More precisely, for this group of cardinality 2k+1 given by U={u ? GF(22k):u2k+1=1}, it is shown that the property of being vectorial bent implies that Im(F)=GF(2k)?{0}, if F is evaluated on U, that is, F(u) takes all possible values of GF(2k)* exactly once and the zero value is taken twice when u ranges over U. This condition is then reformulated in terms of the evaluation of certain elementary symmetric polynomials related to F, which in turn gives some necessary conditions on the coefficients ai (for binomial trace functions) that can be stated explicitly. Finally, we show that a bent trace monomial of Dillon's type Trk2k(?xr(2k-1)) is never a vectorial bent function.

176	Theory analysis of the handover challenge in Express Train Access Networks (ETAN)	Hu Guoqing; Huang Anpeng; He Ruisi; Ai Bo; Chen Zhangyuan	Communications, China	20140911	To handle the handover challenge in Express Train Access Networks (ETAN), mobility fading effects in high speed railway environments should be addressed first. Based on the investigation of fading effects in this paper, we obtain two theoretical bounds: HO-Timing upper bound and HO-Margin lower bound, which are helpful guidelines to study the handover challenge today and in the future. Then, we apply them to analyze performance of conventional handover technologies and our proposal in ETAN. This follow-up theory analyses and simulation experiment results demonstrate that the proposed handover solution can minimize handover time up to 4 ms (which is the fastest one so far), and reduce HO-Margin to 0.16 dB at a train speed of 350 km/h.

The new channel model describes the influence of a power line connected to transceivers. Using the model, we analyzed characteristics of a CC-PAN channel in detail. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the CC-PAN channel can be calculated from the model. It is also shown that the SNR can be enhanced by using a common-mode choke. We also give a physical interpretation of the mechanism of the SNR enhancement. Furthermore, we propose design guidelines to obtain a large-SNR CC-PAN system. The validity of our model and analyses are confirmed by experimental results.

Both the intensity and phase chaos are considered. The regions of injection strength and frequency detuning contributing to TD concealment are identified. The optimal selection of injection delays for the DPI case is also suggested. It is found that, for both intensity and phase chaos, the TD signature for the DPI case can be better concealed in wider parameter regions than that for the SPI case, which is highly desirable for security-enhanced chaotic communication systems as well as high-speed random number generators based on chaotic SLs.

181	Bistatic high range resolution profiles of precessing cone-shaped targets	Ai, X.; Zou, X.; Liu, J.; Li, Y.; Xiao, S.	Radar, Sonar & Navigation, IET	20130805	This study focuses on the bistatic high range resolution profiles (HRRPs) of precessing targets and considers how to utilise bistatic HRRPs for feature extraction. The movement model of the slippery bistatic scattering centres of precessing targets and the wideband bistatic echo model are introduced firstly. The dynamic simulation method of the bistatic HRRPs of the precessing target is presented using the bistatic scattering coefficients obtained via electromagnetic calculations, and the simulation results validate the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the characteristics of the bistatic HRRP are analysed and show that the bistatic HRRP generally reflects the projection of the target onto the bisector of the bistatic angle, except that the bistatic angle is so wide that the bistatic HRRP is quite different from the monostatic HRRP. This research is helpful for imaging, and identifying precessing targets in the bistatic radar.								
182	Small RNA-mediated switch-like regulation in bacterial quorum sensing	Xi Liu; Peipei Zhou; Ruiqi Wang	Systems Biology, IET	20131003	Quorum sensing (QS) is a signalling mechanism by which bacteria produce, release and then detect and respond to changes in their density and biosignals called autoinducers (AIs). There are multiple feedback loops in the QS system of Vibrio harveyi. However, how these feedback loops function to control signal processing remains unclear. In this study, the authors present a computational model for the switch-like regulation of signal transduction by small regulatory RNA-mediated QS based on intertwined network involving AIs, LuxO, LuxU, Qrr sRNAs and LuxR. In agreement with experimental observations, the model suggests that different feedbacks play critical roles in the switch-like regulation. The authors results reveal that V. harveyi uses multiple feedbacks to precisely control signal transduction.

The SSD, based on an asymmetric nanochannel, has a diode-like characteristic that can be utilized in rectifying high-frequency electrical signals. The truly planar structure of the SSD not only provides intrinsically low parasitic capacitance that enables rectification at ultrahigh speed, but also allows the fabrication of a large SSD array in parallel without the need for interconnection layers. The extrinsic voltage responsivity of the SSD-based detector achieved was 15.6 V/W, but the estimated intrinsic voltage responsivity was 45 kV/W.

184	Integration of Error Agency and Representation of Others' Pain in the Anterior Insula	Koban, L; Corradi-Dell'Acqua, C; Vuilleumier, P	Cognitive Neuroscience, Journal of	20140519	A crucial feature of socially adaptive behavior is the ability to recognize when our actions harm other individuals. Previous research demonstrates that dorsal mediofrontal cortex (dMFC) and anterior insula (AI) are involved in both action monitoring and empathy for pain. Here, we tested whether these regions could integrate monitoring of error agency with the representation of others' pain. While undergoing event-related fMRI, participants played a visual task in turns with a friend placed outside the scanner, who would receive painful stimulation in half of the error trials. Brain activity was enhanced in dMFC and AI for painful compared with nonpainful errors. Left AI and dorsolateral pFC also exhibited a significant interaction with agency and increased responses when painful errors were caused by oneself. We conclude that AI is crucial for integrating inferences about others' feeling states with information about action agency and outcome, thus generating an affective signal that may guide subsequent adjustment.

187	Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives	Bengio, Y.; Courville, A.; Vincent, P.	Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on	20130617	The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.

188	Phase Transition Analysis of Target Coverage Problem in Wireless Sensor Networks	Mini, S.; Pujari, A.K.	Sensors Journal, IEEE	20130531	Hardness analysis of combinatorial problems is an important AI-based study of intractable problems. As a domain parameter is made to vary, the hard instances of the problem cluster around a critical value. Thus, there is a phase-transition like situation and the probability of solvability sharply rises from 0 to 1 (or 1 to 0) at the critical value. The aim of this paper is to examine phase-transition behavior of maximum lifetime target coverage problem in wireless sensor networks domain. In this paper, we show that as we vary the uniform sensing range of sensors, the number of hard instances of the problem sharply rises around a critical value independent of other parameters. To facilitate the hardness analysis, we devise a new and efficient algorithm to solve target coverage problem; this algorithm has the distinct ability of distinguishing hard problem instances. The empirical analysis of phase transition is carried out through extensive experimentation.	Target coverage;phase transition;primal-dual approach							
189	Positron annihilation study of structural relaxation and crystallization in a metallic glass Al80Fe8Mo7Ni5 alloy	Abo-Elsoud, M.	Journal of Applied Physics	20130422	Kinetic transformations induced in the metallic glass Al80Fe8Mo7Ni5 by thermal treatments from the amorphous to the crystallized state, following the variation of the Doppler broadening of the positron annihilation line-shaped S-and W-parameters were reported. The behavior of the annihilation line-shape shows reversible and non-reversible contributions. Crystallization of the sample appears as a three-stage process.

191	Adaptive shadow detection using global texture and sampling deduction	Ke Jiang; Ai-hua Li; Zhi-gao Cui; Tao Wang; Yan-zhao Su	Computer Vision, IET	20130527	An adaptive shadow detection algorithm is proposed to eliminate interference on object detection from the shadow. The algorithm uses three components in YUV colour space to identify shadow pixels from the candidate foreground. An adaptive threshold estimator is designed to improve shadow detection accuracy and adaptive capacity in various lighting conditions. This estimator uses edge detection method to obtain global texture, as well statistical calculations to obtain the thresholds. Algorithm has the characteristic of low complexity and little restraint; hence it is suitable for real time-moving shadow detection in various lighting conditions. Experiment results show that this algorithm can obtain a high detection accuracy and the time-assume is greatly shortened compared with other algorithms with similar accuracy.	edge detection;image colour analysis;image matching;image sampling;image texture;interference suppression;lighting;object detection;real-time systems;statistical analysisYUV colour space;adaptive capacity;adaptive shadow detection algorithm;adaptive threshold estimator;edge detection method;global texture;high detection accuracy;interference elimination;lighting conditions;object detection;real time-moving shadow detection;sampling deduction;statistical calculations

A predictive model for the 2-D SLO of Si NWs is presented. In this model, both the reduced reaction rate and diffusivity result in the oxidation rate degradation. The orientation dependence and the deformation of silicon core and oxide shell are further discussed here. The modeling results show good agreement with the experimental data within a wide range of oxidation temperatures, oxidation time, and various initial silicon core sizes. This model provides useful process design guidelines for Si nanostructures, especially in controlling the final diameter and cross-sectional shape of Si NWs from the top-down approach.

193	A New Method of Removing Unsynchronized Signal for ScanSAR Interferometry	Cunren Liang; Qiming Zeng; Jian Jiao; Xi'ai Cui	Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, IEEE	20121022	We have analyzed most of the commonly used burst-mode focusing algorithms and chose the one that can be easily combined with unsynchronized-signal removal. In order to remove the unsynchronized signal in scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) interferometry, we calculate the burst synchronization using satellite state vectors at first. Then, based on the focusing algorithm chosen and the synchronization calculated, we propose a method to remove the unsynchronized signal. The method rejects the unsynchronized phase and keeps all of the magnitude information. It has been tested with simulated Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ScanSAR data, and the result demonstrated that the method could effectively remove the unsynchronized signal for ScanSAR interferometric processing.

195	A Simulation Platform for ZigBee-UMTS Hybrid Networks	Lei Zhou; Ying Zhu; Ai Chen; Cong Liu	Communications Letters, IEEE	20130307	A ZigBee Network is a low-cost and low-power wireless network based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which allows wireless connectivity with limited power and relaxed throughput requirements. On the other hand, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third-generation cellular network that provides high-speed wireless traffic transfer to the Internet. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel integrated ZigBee and UMTS hybrid network in the Network Simulator (ns-2). In this hybrid network, we design a new Mobile Gateway to interconnect these two different sub-networks. With the hierarchical addressing and some special UMTS network discovering mechanisms, routing in the hybrid network, from the ZigBee network via the UMTS network to the wired network, is achieved. We also design a simulation platform to make it easier for protocol designers to design and evaluate new protocols in such a hybrid network.

196	Database-Driven Real-Time Heuristic Search in Video-Game Pathfinding	Lawrence, R.; Bulitko, V.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130911	Real-time heuristic search algorithms satisfy a constant bound on the amount of planning per action, independent of the problem size. These algorithms are useful when the amount of time or memory resources are limited, or a rapid response time is required. An example of such a problem is pathfinding in video games where numerous units may be simultaneously required to react promptly to a player's commands. Classic real-time heuristic search algorithms cannot be deployed due to their obvious state revisitation (ﾓscrubbingﾔ). Recent algorithms have improved performance by using a database of precomputed subgoals. However, a common issue is that the precomputation time can be large, and there is no guarantee that the precomputed data adequately cover the search space. In this paper, we present a new approach that guarantees coverage by abstracting the search space, using the same algorithm that performs the real-time search. It reduces the precomputation time via the use of dynamic programming. The new approach eliminates the learning component and the resultant ﾓscrubbing.ﾔ Experimental results on maps of tens of millions of grid cells from Counter-Strike: Source and benchmark maps from Dragon Age: Origins show significantly faster execution times and improved optimality results compared to previous real-time algorithms.

197	Crowdsourcing the Aesthetics of Platform Games	Shaker, N.; Yannakakis, G.N.; Togelius, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130911	What are the aesthetics of platform games and what makes a platform level engaging, challenging, and/or frustrating? We attempt to answer such questions through mining a large set of crowdsourced gameplay data of a clone of the classic platform game Super Mario Bros (SMB). The data consist of 40 short game levels that differ along six key level design parameters. Collectively, these levels are played 1560 times over the Internet, and the perceived experience is annotated by experiment participants via self-reported ranking (pairwise preferences). Given the wealth of this crowdsourced data, as all details about players' in-game behavior are logged, the problem becomes one of extracting meaningful numerical features at the appropriate level of abstraction for the construction of generic computational models of player experience and, thereby, game aesthetics. We explore dissimilar types of features, including direct measurements of event and item frequencies, and features constructed through frequent sequence mining, and go through an in-depth analysis of the interrelationship between level content, players' behavioral patterns, and reported experience. Furthermore, the fusion of the extracted features allows us to predict reported player experience with a high accuracy, even from short game segments. In addition to advancing our insight on the factors that contribute to platform game aesthetics, the results are useful for the personalization of game experience via automatic game adaptation.

198	Error Probability Analysis of Interleaved SC-FDMA Systems Over Nakagami-    Frequency-Selective Fading Channels	Miaowen Wen; Xiang Cheng; Miao Wang; Bo Ai; Bingli Jiao	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20130212	In this paper, we present an analytical study of the average bit error probability (ABEP) for interleaved single-carrier frequency-division multiple-access (SC-FDMA) systems over independent but not necessarily identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels with fading parameters {m} being integers when either zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) frequency-domain equalization (FDE) is applied. Under the assumption of independence among channel frequency responses (CFRs) at the allocated subcarriers for a specific user, accurate and closed-form numerical ABEP computations of the generalized hierarchical M -ary pulse amplitude and square/rectangular M-ary quadrature amplitude modulations for both ZF-FDE and MMSE-FDE are developed by exploiting the derived statistics of the equalized noise, including the probability density function and cumulative distribution function. More importantly, the ABEP derivation is based on the real distribution of the CFRs without applying the widely used Nakagami-m approximation of the CFRs in previous literature, resulting in a more accurate ABEP analysis.

199	Monte Carlo Search Algorithm Discovery for Single-Player Games	Maes, F.; St-Pierre, D.L.; Ernst, D.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130911	Much current research in AI and games is being devoted to Monte Carlo search (MCS) algorithms. While the quest for a single unified MCS algorithm that would perform well on all problems is of major interest for AI, practitioners often know in advance the problem they want to solve, and spend plenty of time exploiting this knowledge to customize their MCS algorithm in a problem-driven way. We propose an MCS algorithm discovery scheme to perform this in an automatic and reproducible way. First, we introduce a grammar over MCS algorithms that enables inducing a rich space of candidate algorithms. Afterwards, we search in this space for the algorithm that performs best on average for a given distribution of training problems. We rely on multiarmed bandits to approximately solve this optimization problem. The experiments, generated on three different domains, show that our approach enables discovering algorithms that outperform several well-known MCS algorithms such as upper confidence bounds applied to trees and nested Monte Carlo search. We also show that the discovered algorithms are generally quite robust with respect to changes in the distribution over the training problems.

200	Assessment of the Incremental Conductance Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithm	Elgendy, M.A.; Zahawi, B.; Atkinson, D.J.	Sustainable Energy, IEEE Transactions on	20121212	An efficient, cost-effective maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is required to improve the energy utilization efficiency of low power photovoltaic (PV) systems. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the incremental conductance MPPT algorithm when employed by a standalone PV pumping system, using an experimental installation comprised of a 1080-Wp photovoltaic array connected to a 1-kW permanent magnet dc motor-centrifugal pump set. Particular focus is given to the evaluation of the two commonly utilized implementation techniques: reference voltage perturbation and direct duty ratio perturbation. The influence of algorithm parameters on system behavior is investigated and the energy utilization efficiency is calculated for different weather conditions. The performance of the incremental conductance algorithm is compared to that of the commonly used perturb and observe MPPT algorithm and the various advantages and drawbacks of each technique are identified.

201	Saving photo slides [Resources_Tools]	Zorpette, G.	Spectrum, IEEE	20130321	"If you're old enough to have been called a ""shutterbug,"" you've probably got a bunch of slides or film somewhere that you've fantasized about digitizing. Well, a new scanner system, flawed though it is, may be what you're looking for. ﾷ Film scanning is recovering from a market implosion several years ago, when big players Canon, Minolta, and Nikon all either got out of the business or cut back their offerings. That left fewer than a dozen companies competing in the market for 35-mm film scanners. One of the most interesting of this group is Plustek Technology, whose new model, the OpticFilm 8200i Ai, offers impressive value. ﾷ Available now in stores for about US $430, it can scan at 7200 dots per inchﾗhigh enough to show the grain in a photograph, no matter how fine-grain the film is. Its image-sensing component is a charge-coupled-device combined with an LED light source. Like all film scanners, the Plustek is equally adept at scanning negatives and slides. ﾷ But good hardware is useless without good software. It's a big challenge for a scanner, because the software has to control so many variables, including spatial and color resolution, output format, and many optimization and correction parameters. The Plustek comes bundled with software called SilverFast, which is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple's OS X. ﾷ SilverFast has an intuitive user interface. It enabled me to control the key factors of a scan with few false starts and with minimal use of the thin and mediocre reference booklet that comes with the software. Unfortunately, however, I also encountered a significant bug. Every time I tried to make a scan with the highest color depthﾗ64-bitﾗthe software crashed. This instability surprised me, because the software is now on version 8. (I was running it on my powerful iMac computer.) ﾷ The Plustek scanner can perform several different kinds of scans, but they boil down to two- basic types. One is an ""archival"" scan, which strives to capture every detail and aspect of the slide as faithfully as possible."								
202	On the Use of Games for Noninvasive EEG-Based Functional Brain Mapping	Scherer, R.; Moitzi, G.; Daly, I.; Muller-Putz, G.R.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	The use of statistical models and statistical inference for characterizing the interplay between brain structures and human behavior (functional brain mapping) is common in neuroscience. Statistical methods, however, require the availability of sufficiently large data sets. As a result, experimental paradigms used to collect behavioral trials from individuals are data centered and not user centered. This means that experimental paradigms are tuned to collect as many trials as possible, are generally rather demanding, and are not always motivating or engaging for individuals. Subject cooperation and their compliance with the task may decrease over time. Whenever possible, paradigms are designed to control for factors such as fatigue, attention, and motivation. In this paper, we propose the use of the Kinect motion tracking sensor (Microsoft, Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) in a game-based paradigm for noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based functional motor mapping. Results from an experimental study with able-bodied subjects playing a virtual ball game suggest that the Kinect sensor is useful for isolating specific movements during the interaction with the game, and that the computed EEG patterns for hand and feet movements are in agreement with results described in the literature.

204	Hybrid wire-surface wave interconnects for next-generation networks-on-chip	Karkar, A.J.; Turner, J.E.; Tong, K.; AI-Dujaily, R.; Mak, T.; Yakovlev, A.; Fei Xia	Computers & Digital Techniques, IET	20131031	Networks-on-chip (NoC) is a communication paradigm that has emerged to tackle different on-chip challenges and satisfy different demands in terms of high performance and economical interconnect implementation. However, merely metal-based NoC pursuit offers limited scalability with the relentless technology scaling especially in global communications. To meet the scalability demand, this study proposes a new hybrid architecture empowered by both metal interconnect and Zenneck surface waves interconnects (SWIs). This architecture reduces the NoC average hop count between any communication pairs, which has been reflected as a better average delay and throughput. Furthermore, SWI enables more efficient power dissipation and faster cross the chip signal propagation. The authors' initial results based on a cycle-accurate simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture, such as significant power reduction (23%), large average delay reduction (34%) and higher throughput (35%) compared with regular NoC. These results are achieved with negligible hardware and area overhead. This study explores promising potentials of SWI for future complex global communication.	economics;integrated circuit interconnections;network-on-chipNoC;SWI;Zenneck surface waves interconnects;chip signal propagation;economical interconnect;global communications;hybrid wire-surface wave interconnects;next-generation networks-on-chip

208	VLSI Architectures for the 4-Tap and 6-Tap 2-D Daubechies Wavelet Filters Using Algebraic Integers	Madishetty, S.K.; Madanayake, A.; Cintra, R.J.; Dimitrov, V.S.; Mugler, D.H.	Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, IEEE Transactions on	20130523	This paper proposes a novel algebraic integer (AI) based multi-encoding of Daubechies-4 and -6 2-D wavelet filters having error-free integer-based computation. Digital VLSI architectures employing parallel channels are proposed, physically realized and tested. The multi-encoded AI framework allows a multiplication-free and computationally accurate architecture. It also guarantees a noise-free computation throughput the multi-level multi-rate 2-D filtering operation. A single final reconstruction step (FRS) furnishes filtered and down-sampled image outputs in fixed-point, resulting in low levels of quantization noise. Comparisons are provided between Daubechies-4 and -6 designs in terms of SNR, PSNR, hardware structure, and power consumptions, for different word lengths. SNR and PSNR improvements of approximately 30% were observed in favour of AI-based systems, when compared to 8-bit fixed-point schemes (six fractional bits). Further, FRS designs based on canonical signed digit representation and on expansion factors are proposed. The Daubechies-4 and -6 4-level VLSI architectures are prototyped on a Xilinx Virtex-6 vcx240t-1ff1156 FPGA device at 282 MHz and 146 MHz, respectively, with dynamic power consumption of 164 mW and 339 mW, respectively, and verified on FPGA chip using an ML605 platform.

209	A Single-Channel Architecture for Algebraic Integer-Based 8  8 2-D DCT Computation	Edirisuriya, A.; Madanayake, A.; Cintra, R.J.; Dimitrov, V.S.; Rajapaksha, N.	Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20131128	An area efficient row-parallel architecture is proposed for the real-time implementation of bivariate algebraic integer (AI) encoded 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) for image and video processing. The proposed architecture computes 8 � 8 2-D DCT transform based on the Arai DCT algorithm. An improved fast algorithm for AI-based 1-D DCT computation is proposed along with a single channel 2-D DCT architecture. The design improves on the four-channel AI DCT architecture that was published recently by reducing the number of integer channels to one and the number of eight-point 1-D DCT cores from five down to two. The architecture offers exact computation of 8 � 8 blocks of the 2-D DCT coefficients up to the FRS, which converts the coefficients from the AI representation to fixed-point format using the method of expansion factors. Prototype circuits corresponding to FRS blocks based on two expansion factors are realized, tested, and verified on FPGA-chip, using a Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T device. Post place-and-route results show a 20% reduction in terms of area compared to the 2-D DCT architecture requiring five 1-D AI cores. The area-time and area-time2 complexity metrics are also reduced by 23% and 22% respectively for designs with eight-bit input word length. The digital realizations are simulated up to place and route for ASICs using 45 nm CMOS standard cells. The maximum estimated clock rate is 951 MHz for the CMOS realizations indicating 7.608�109 pixels/s and a 8 � 8 block rate of 118.875 MHz.

213	Learning and Reasoning in Cognitive Radio Networks	Gavrilovska, L.; Atanasovski, V.; Macaluso, I.; DaSilva, L.A.	Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE	20131112	Cognitive radio networks challenge the traditional wireless networking paradigm by introducing concepts firmly stemmed into the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, i.e., learning and reasoning. This fosters optimal resource usage and management allowing a plethora of potential applications such as secondary spectrum access, cognitive wireless backbones, cognitive machine-to-machine etc. The majority of overview works in the field of cognitive radio networks deal with the notions of observation and adaptations, which are not a distinguished cognitive radio networking aspect. Therefore, this paper provides insight into the mechanisms for obtaining and inferring knowledge that clearly set apart the cognitive radio networks from other wireless solutions.

215	Repeated Goofspiel: A Game of Pure Strategy	Dror, M.; Kendall, G.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20131211	In this paper, we examine a pure strategy game known as Goofspiel and report on the results of round-robin competitions between 14 programs designed to play this game. Goofspiel is a two-person card game that is easy to play. However, playing this game successfully has proven to be a difficult task. There is no known ﾓgoodﾔ strategy for Goofspiel. This is the first time that playing Goofspiel has been examined in a context of a round-robin competition between programs. None of the participating programs won consistently against its rivals. Thus, no clear dominating strategy of play has emerged. In this respect, Goofspiel is similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma where Tit-for-Tat has proven to be a good strategy against many but not against all. This paper introduces Repeated Goofspiel and presents preliminary experimental results. We hope it will motivate further research into this fascinating game.

217	Game AI Competitions: An Open Platform for Computational Intelligence Education [Educational Forum]	Kyung-Joong Kim; Sung-Bae Cho	Computational Intelligence Magazine, IEEE	20130710	Teaching computational intelligence (CI) to undergraduate and/or graduate students is challenging because the theories are difficult and they feel that the topics are not closely related to their lives. It is desirable to use interesting projects to attract students' attention into the computational intelligence. CI educators have been used different types of tools to define course projects for students. There are no standard course materials on the projects, hence each instructor develops his/her own projects by oneself, making it difficult to share them. Furthermore, if the projects are dependent on special hardware or software, it often becomes a bottleneck on the dissemination of the materials.	,Computational intelligence;Education courses;Engineering education;Evolutionary computing;Standards,artificial intelligence;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational coursesCI;computational intelligence education;course projects;educational forum;game AI competitions;graduate students;open platform;standard course materials;teaching computational intelligence							
218	Novel Adaptive Algorithm for Intra Prediction With Compromised Modes Skipping and Signaling Processes in HEVC	Li-li Wang; Wan-Chi Siu	Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20130930	Up to 35 intra prediction modes are available for each Luma prediction unit in the coming HEVC standard. This can provide more accurate predictions and thereby improve the compression efficiency of intra coding. However, the encoding complexity is thus increased dramatically due to a large number of modes involved in the intra mode decision process. In addition, more overhead bits should be assigned to signal the mode index. Intuitively, it is not necessary for all modes to be checked and signaled all the time. Therefore, a novel adaptive modes skipping algorithm for mode decision and signaling processing is presented in this paper. More specifically, three optimized candidate sets with 1, 19, and 35 intra prediction modes are initiated for each prediction unit in the proposed algorithm. Based on the statistical properties of the neighboring reference samples used for intra prediction, the proposed algorithm is able to adaptively select the optimal set from the three candidates for each prediction unit preceding the mode decision and signaling processing. As a result, the mode decision process can be speeded up due to some modes skipping in the first two sets, and importantly less bits are required to signal the mode index. Experimental results show that, compared to the test model HM7.0 of HEVC, BD-Rate savings of 0.18% and as well as 0.18% on average are achieved for AI-Main and AI-HE10 cases for low-bitrate ranges, and the average encoding times can also be reduced by 8%-38% and 8%-34% for AI-Main and AI-HE10 cases in low-bitrate ranges, respectively.

221	A Problem Case for UCT	Browne, C.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130313	This paper examines a simple 5 � 5 Hex position that not only completely defeats flat Monte Carlo search, but also initially defeats plain upper confidence bounds for trees (UCT) search until an excessive number of iterations are performed. The inclusion of domain knowledge during playouts significantly improves UCT performance, but a slight negative effect is shown for the rapid action value estimate (RAVE) heuristic under some circumstances. This example was drawn from an actual game during standard play, and highlights the dangers of relying on flat Monte Carlo and unenhanced UCT search even for rough estimates. A brief comparison is made with RAVE failure in Go.

222	Two Brains, One Game: Design and Evaluation of a Multiuser BCI Video Game Based on Motor Imagery	Bonnet, L.; Lotte, F.; Lecuyer, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	How can we connect two brains to a video game by means of a brain-computer interface (BCI), and what will happen when we do so? How will the two users behave, and how will they perceive this novel common experience? In this paper, we are concerned with the design and evaluation of multiuser BCI applications. We created a multiuser videogame called BrainArena in which two users can play a simple football game by means of two BCIs. They can score goals on the left or right side of the screen by simply imagining left or right hand movements. To add another interesting element, the gamers can play in a collaborative manner (their two mental activities are combined to score in the same goal), or in a competitive manner (the gamers must push the ball in opposite directions). Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance and subjective experience of users in the different conditions. In the first experiment, we compared a single-user situation with one multiuser situation: the collaborative task. Experiment 1 showed that multiuser conditions are significantly preferred, in terms of fun and motivation, compared to the single-user condition. The performance of some users was even significantly improved in the multiuser condition. A subset of well-performing subjects was involved in the second experiment, where we added the competitive task. Experiment 2 suggested that competitive and collaborative conditions may lead to similar performances and motivations. However, the corresponding gaming experiences can be perceived differently among the participants. Taken together our results suggest that multiuser BCI applications can be operational, effective, and more engaging for participants.

223	Nonlinear Companding Transform for Reduction of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio in OFDM Systems	Yong Wang; Jianhua Ge; Lihua Wang; Jing Li; Bo Ai	Broadcasting, IEEE Transactions on	20130520	High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal is one of the limitations to employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear companding algorithm that transforms the OFDM signals into the desirable statistics form defined by a linear piecewise function. By introducing the variable slopes and an inflexion point in the target probability density function, more flexibility in the companding form and an effective trade-off between the PAPR and bit error rate performances can be achieved. A theoretical performance study for this algorithm is presented and closed-form expressions regarding the achievable transform gain and signal attenuation factor are provided. We also investigate the selection criteria of transform parameters focusing on its robustness and overall performance aspects. The presented theoretical analyses are well verified via computer simulations.

225	Controlling a Tactile ERPﾖBCI in a Dual Task	Thurlings, M.E.; Van Erp, J.B.F.; Brouwer, A.-M.; Werkhoven, P.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	When using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to control a game, the BCI may have to compete with gaming tasks for the same perceptual and cognitive resources. We investigated: 1) if and to what extent event-related potentials (ERPs) and ERP-BCI performance are affected in a dual-task situation; and 2) if these effects are an area function of the level of difficulty of a concurrent task. Ten participants performed an ERP-BCI task that involved attending to a target location in sequences of tactile stimuli. The ERP-BCI task was performed either in isolation or secondary to a visual n-back task with two levels of difficulty. We observed: 1) a decreased P300 and BCI bit rate, and an increased level of subjective mental effort for both dual-task conditions compared to the BCI-only condition; the decreased classification accuracies were still well above chance, but arguably too low for effective BCI control; and 2) we did not find an effect of task difficulty on the P300, bit rates, and subjective mental effort. We discuss reallocation of attention caused by a concurrent task, but unaffected by task difficulty, and the role of task priority. Concluding, control of a tactile ERP-BCI in a dual-task situation is feasible, but performance is degraded.

226	Condition assessment of power transformers using a synthetic analysis method based on association rule and variable weight coefficients	Lee Li; Xie Longjun; Zhang Deng; Yu Bin; Ge Yafeng; Lin Fuchang	Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, IEEE Transactions on	20131211	Condition assessment for power transformer requires not only integrating the known artificial intelligence (AI) technology, but also exploiting the interrelation of the measured data. According to the association rule of information data and the variable weight synthesizing theory of factor spaces, an assessment method of transformer condition was proposed in this paper. Via analyzing the interrelation of the independent status parameters (ISP) and transformer fault types, the set of synthetic status parameters (SSP) can be built up. For avoiding interference from subjective experience, association rule theory was used to calculate the constant weight coefficients (CWC) of the ISPs. Since the true transformer condition may not always be accurately reflected under the condition of CWCs of a few SSPs, the method of variable weight synthesizing was used for computing the variable weight coefficients (VWC) of the SSPs. Then, combining with the existing maintenance procedures, a preferable condition assessing system of power transformer was proposed. Operational example proved the condition assessing system may reflect the real operation condition of power transformer.

227	A Heuristic-Based Planner and Improved Controller for a Two-Layered Approach for the Game of Billiards	Landry, J.-F.; Dussault, J.-P.; Mahey, P.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20131211	In the past , we have proposed a two-layered approach to compute a winning strategy for the game of Billiards. AI tools as well as robust optimization routines for noisy environments were combined to plan the sequence of shots. We complete the modeling here by introducing significant developments for the high-level planner which guides the precise optimal controller to generate a plan given at any random initial state. We will first resume the general model for this particular class of problems and then propose several domain-specific heuristics to guide our search and render the problem tractable. Several improvements to the optimal robust controller, including refinements in the objective function, will also be presented in order to improve single-shot optimization. Results are presented demonstrating the full potential of the methods proposed making it the state of the art in regards to the game of Billiards.

229	Complete Propagation Model in Tunnels	Ke Guan; Zhangdui Zhong; Bo Ai; Ruisi He; Binghao Chen; Yuanxuan Li; Briso-Rodriguez, C.	Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters, IEEE	20130709	The wave propagation in tunnels does not only depend on the carrier frequency and properties of the tunnel, but also differs along with the distance between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). This letter presents a complete structure and model for propagation in tunnels. Compared to existing models, the complete model unifies different academic viewpoints, reveals all possible propagation mechanisms, and localizes all the dividing points between every two adjacent propagation mechanism zones. When the user is close to the Tx, the propagation is dominated by the free-space mechanism, then the multimode mechanism is established. Afterwards, when the high-order modes have been largely attenuated, the fundamental-mode guided propagation is dominant. Finally, when the user is extremely far away, the waveguide effect vanishes because of attenuation of reflected rays. Measurements and simulations validate the model. This complete structure and model can be essential to establish a comprehensive understanding of the propagation in tunnels and can be applied for network planning and interference analysis of advanced communication systems.

236	Backward Induction and Repeated Games With Strategy Constraints: An Inspiration From the Surprise Exam Paradox	Jiawei Li; Kendall, G.; Vasilakos, A.V.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130911	Backward induction has led to some controversy in specific games, the surprise exam paradox and iterated prisoner's dilemma for example, despite its wide use in solving finitely repeated games with complete information. In this paper, a typical misuse of backward induction is revealed by analyzing the surprise exam paradox, and the reason why backward induction may fail is investigated. The surprise exam paradox represents a set of repeated games with strategy constraints and has not been fully investigated in game theory. The agents in real-world activities always face constraints in decision making, for example, a budget limitation. In a repeated game with strategy constraints, the players' choices in different stages are not independent and later choices depend on previous choices because of the strategy constraints. Backward induction cannot be applied in its normal use and it needs to be combined with Bayes' theorem in solving these kinds of problems. We also investigate how the strategy constraints influence the equilibrium and show how to solve repeated games with strategy constraints by analyzing a repeated battle of the sexes game with a budget constraint.

Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on	20130329	This paper describes a task-based, information-theoretic approach to the assessment of image quality in diagnostic sonography. We expand the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric J, which quantifies the diagnostic information contained within recorded radio-frequency echo signals, into a spatial-frequency integral comprised of two spectral components: one describes patient features for low-contrast diagnostic tasks and the other describes instrumentation properties. The latter quantity is the acquisition information spectrum (AIS), which measures the density of object information that an imaging system is able to transfer to the echo data at each spatial frequency. AIS is derived based on unique properties of acoustic scattering in tissues that generate object contrast. Predictions made by the J integral expression were validated through Monte Carlo studies using echo-signal data from simulated lesions. Our analysis predicts the diagnostic performance of any sonographic system at specific diagnostic tasks based on engineering properties of the instrument that constitute image quality.

238	Efficient organic-inorganic hybrid Schottky solar cell: The role of built-in potential	Zhu, Yawen; Song, Tao; Zhang, Fute; Lee, Shuit-Tong; Sun, Baoquan	Applied Physics Letters	20130321	The organic-inorganic hybrid Schottky solar cells based on solution processed poly(3,4-ethlenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in combination with silicon offer the merits of simple fabrication process and potential low cost. Here, we demonstrate that the work function (WF) of PEDOT:PSS films plays a critical role on the electronic output characteristics of the device. The WF of PEDOT:PSS is tuned by adding an aqueous solution of perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) due to its high electron affinity, which is compatible to fabricate the hybrid Si/PEDOT:PSS device. With an addition of 4% (weight) PFI into PEDOT:PSS, the device achieves a fill factor (FF) as high as 0.70 without sacrifice of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density, which improves 20% in comparison with the pristine PEDOT:PSS (0.58). The detailed electrical output measurements reveal that the high FF is ascribed to the enhanced built-in potential as well as suppression of charge recombination at organic-inorganic interface.

239	Games, Gameplay, and BCI: The State of the Art	Marshall, D.; Coyle, D.; Wilson, S.; Callaghan, M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and basic computer games have been interconnected since BCI development began, exploiting gameplay elements as a means of enhancing performance in BCI training protocols and entertaining and challenging participants while training to use a BCI. By providing the BCI user with an entertaining environment, researchers hope to assist users in becoming more proficient at controlling a BCI system. BCIs have been used to enrich the experience of abled-bodied and physically impaired users in various computer applications, in particular, computer games. BCI games have been reviewed previously, yet a critical evaluation of ﾓgameplayﾔ within BCI games has not been undertaken. Gameplay is a key aspect of any computer game and encompasses the challenges presented to the player, the actions made available to the player by the game designer to overcome the challenges and the interaction mechanism in the game. Here, the appropriateness of game genres (a category of games characterized by a particular set of gameplay challenges) and the associated gameplay challenges for different BCI paradigms is evaluated. The gameplay mechanics employed across a range of BCI games are reviewed and evaluated in terms of the BCI control strategy's suitability, considering the genre and gameplay mechanics employed. A number of recommendations for the field relating to genre-specific BCI-games development and assessing user performance are also provided for BCI game developers.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	The P300-based brain-computer interface (P300 BCI) is currently a very popular topic in assistive technology development. However, only a few simple P300 BCI-based games have been designed so far. Here, we analyze the shortcomings of this BCI in gaming applications and show that solutions for overcoming them already exist, although these techniques are dispersed over several different games. Additionally, new approaches to improve the P300 BCI accuracy and flexibility are currently being proposed in the more general P300 BCI research. The P300 BCI, even in its current form, not only exhibits relatively high speed and accuracy, but also can be used without user training, after a short calibration. Taking these facts together, the broader use of the P300 BCI in BCI-controlled video games is recommended.

Such an approach is well suited to a distributed computing environment, since these jobs are allowed to be run by remote processors independently. In this paper, we present and focus on a job-level proof number search (JL-PNS), a kind of generic job-level search for solving computer game search problems, and apply JL-PNS to solving automatically several Connect6 positions, including some difficult openings. This paper also proposes a method of postponed sibling generation to generate nodes smoothly, and some policies, such as virtual win, virtual loss, virtual equivalence, flagging, or hybrids of the above, to expand the nodes. Our experiment compared these policies, and the results showed that the virtual-equivalence policy, together with flagging, performed the best against other policies.

242	A Neurally Controlled Computer Game Avatar With Humanlike Behavior	Gamez, D.; Fountas, Z.; Fidjeland, A.K.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130313	This paper describes the NeuroBot system, which uses a global workspace architecture, implemented in spiking neurons, to control an avatar within the Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004) computer game. This system is designed to display humanlike behavior within UT2004, which provides a good environment for comparing human and embodied AI behavior without the cost and difficulty of full humanoid robots. Using a biologically inspired approach, the architecture is loosely based on theories about the high-level control circuits in the brain, and it is the first neural implementation of a global workspace that has been embodied in a complex dynamic real-time environment. NeuroBot's humanlike behavior was tested by competing in the 2011 BotPrize competition, in which human judges play UT2004 and rate the humanness of other avatars that are controlled by a human or a bot. NeuroBot came a close second, achieving a humanness rating of 36%, while the most human human reached 67%. We also developed a humanness metric that combines a number of statistical measures of an avatar's behavior into a single number. In our experiments with this metric, NeuroBot was rated as 33% human, and the most human human achieved 73%.

243	Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential-Based Computer Gaming on a Consumer-Grade EEG Device	Chumerin, N.; Manyakov, N.V.; van Vliet, M.; Robben, A.; Combaz, A.; Van Hulle, M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	In this paper, we introduce a game in which the player navigates an avatar through a maze by using a brain-computer interface (BCI) that analyzes the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) on the player's scalp. The four-command control game, called The Maze, was specifically designed around an SSVEP BCI and validated in several EEG setups when using a traditional electrode cap with relocatable electrodes and a consumer-grade headset with fixed electrodes (Emotiv EPOC). We experimentally derive the parameter values that provide an acceptable tradeoff between accuracy of game control and interactivity, and evaluate the control provided by the BCI during gameplay. As a final step in the validation of the game, a population study on a broad audience was conducted with the EPOC headset in a real-world setting. The study revealed that the majority (85%) of the players enjoyed the game in spite of its intricate control (mean accuracy 80.37%, mean mission time ratio 0.90). We also discuss what to take into account while designing BCI-based games.

246	Tracking Infectious Disease Spread for Global Pandemic Containment	Kwok-Leung Tsui; Wong, Z.S.-Y.; Goldsman, D.; Edesess, M.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20140206	Simulation studies play a significant role in supporting pandemic disease scenario prediction and facilitating the understanding of how infectious diseases spread. This is of paramount importance for the anticipation, mitigation, and containment of pandemics. Disease-spread simulation models are often used to understand the effects of changes in citizen behavior or government policies, or to study disease outbreak parameters and mitigation-strategy features. Here, we focus on how to improve future global pandemic containment with the help of advanced artificial intelligence and simulation methods.

248	Detect-and-Forward Relaying Aided Cooperative Spatial Modulation for Wireless Networks	Yang, Ping; Zhang, Bo; Xiao, Yue; Dong, Binhong; Li, Shaoqian; El-Hajjar, Mohammed; Hanzo, Lajos	Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20131128	A novel detect-and-forward (DeF) relaying aided cooperative SM scheme is proposed, which is capable of striking a flexible tradeoff in terms of the achievable bit error ratio (BER), complexity and unequal error protection (UEP). More specifically, SM is invoked at the source node (SN) and the information bit stream is divided into two different sets: the antenna index-bits (AI-bits) as well as the amplitude and phase modulation-bits (APM-bits). By exploiting the different importance of the AI-bits and the APM-bits in SM detection, we propose three low-complexity, yet powerful relay protocols, namely the partial, the hybrid and the hierarchical modulation (HM) based DeF relaying schemes. These schemes determine the most appropriate number of bits to be re-modulated by carefully considering their potential benefits and then assigning a specific modulation scheme for relaying the message. As a further benefit, the employment of multiple radio frequency (RF) chains and the requirement of tight inter-relay synchronization (IRS) can be avoided. Moreover, by exploiting the benefits of our low-complexity relaying protocols and our inter-element interference (IEI) model, a low-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is proposed for jointly detecting the signal received both via the source-destination (SD) and relay-destination (RD) links. Additionally, an upper bound of the BER is derived for our DeF-SM scheme. Our numerical results show that the bound is asymptotically tight in the high-SNR region and the proposed schemes provide beneficial system performance improvements compared to the conventional MIMO schemes in an identical cooperative scenario.

249	Optimization of an Evaluation Function of the Four-Sided Dominos Game Using a Genetic Algorithm	Antonio, N.S.; Costa Filho, C.F.F.; Costa, M.G.F.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130313	In four-sided Dominos, the popular way of playing Dominos in Amazonas State, in Brazil, the strategies used for the game are more complex than those adopted in the more traditional two-sided Dominos, the most popular domino game played in Brazil. This work presents the optimization of an evaluation function for the best move in four-sided Dominos using a genetic algorithm (GA). The evaluation function comprises terms incorporating game strategies defined as: punctuating, facilitating future moves, and complicating opponents' moves. Coefficients were defined to determine the importance of each term of the evaluation function and a set of parameters and operators for implementing the GA. The players' ability was calculated by the number of wins in 5000 matches. The results obtained during the simulations showed that the team (consisting of two players) using the evaluation function with its coefficients optimized by the GA won in more than 69.18% of the total matches.

250	Exact Analysis of Frequency Splitting Phenomena of Contactless Power Transfer Systems	Wang-Qiang Niu; Jian-Xin Chu; Wei Gu; Ai-Di Shen	Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, IEEE Transactions on	20130523	Frequency splitting phenomena are investigated systematically by circuit theory in a series-tuned contactless power transfer (CPT) system. First, in a symmetrical CPT system, the splitting equation is defined and the key frequency splitting characteristics are described by the trough and the ridge equations in a complete fashion. The even and the odd splitting frequencies are exactly two roots of the ridge equation; the splitting coupling is determined theoretically when the even and odd splitting frequencies merge together. Second, in an unsymmetrical CPT system, the idea of the trough and the ridge equation is exploited to find exactly the splitting coupling. Next, the relationship between frequency bifurcation and splitting is elucidated; and a zero-phase control method is suggested to track the splitting frequency when the coupling changes in the splitting region. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by a 10-W prototype with planar spiral coils.

254	Designing Automated Allocation Mechanisms for Service Procurement of Imperfectly Substitutable Services	Kruse, S.; Brintrup, A.; McFarlane, D.; Sanchez Lopez, T.; Owens, K.; Krechel, W.E.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130313	Self-serving assets (SSAs) are a new interpretation of the intelligent product technology, set to transform product lifecycle management through automation. SSAs are engineering assets that autonomously monitor their health and expiry dates, search for suppliers, and negotiate with them, while they are still in use by the customer. The concept enables more timely and transparent supplier decision making while eliminating central database transactions and tedious manual effort. Autonomous self-interested agents that act on behalf of their stakeholders naturally give rise to an allocation problem, under the assumption of private information held by trade parties and capacity constrained suppliers providing imperfectly substitutable goods (ISGs). In this paper, we develop and compare three automated competition mechanisms, constructed as iterative games, and test them in the context of the aerospace service supply chain. The competition mechanisms include a prioritized selection mechanism, extended Vickrey, and reverse Dutch auctions. Our context drives us to seek mechanisms that will not only perform well in terms of economic theory, but also in terms of computational performance. Key findings are that extended Vickrey auctions can handle multiple criteria and provide higher market efficiency at lower computational cost, especially in small to medium markets. As scalability is an issue in large markets, the use of auctions is recommended only for complex high value assets or under uncertain market scenarios. As business-to-business (B2B) environments are becoming the norm for many global companies, our study aims to be exemplary to those who would like to implement automated auction mechanisms in highly complex environments.

255	Measurements and Analysis of Propagation Channels in High-Speed Railway Viaducts	Ruisi He; Zhangdui Zhong; Bo Ai; Gongpu Wang; Jianwen Ding; Molisch, A.F.	Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20130307	"This paper reports (i) a set of measurements of the wireless propagation channel at 930 MHz, conducted along the ""Zhengzhou-Xian"" high-speed railway of China in various railway viaduct scenarios, and (ii) an analysis and modeling of the small-scale and large-scale channel parameters based on those measurements. The environment can be categorized into four cases, covering viaducts with different heights and in different suburban environments. Small values of fade depth, level crossing rates, and average fade duration are observed. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)-based evaluation indicates that the Ricean distribution is the best to describe small-scale amplitude fading. An analysis of the envelope autocovariance function shows that the coherence distance is less than 10 cm. The Ricean K-factor is modeled as a piecewise-linear function of distance. Moreover, a breakpoint path loss model is developed and shadow fading is investigated using the same break point as for the distance-dependent K-factor model. The Suzuki distribution is found to offer a good fit for the composite multipath/shadowing channels. We find that the viaduct height H, together with the number of surrounding scatterers, significantly affects the small- and large-scale channel parameters. These results are applicable to both normal-speed and high-speed railways, and will be useful in the modeling of railway viaduct channels and the design of railway wireless communication systems."

256	A Mobility-Aware Node Deployment and Tree Construction Framework for ZigBee Wireless Networks	Yuan-Yao Shih; Wei-Ho Chung; Pi-Cheng Hsiu; Ai-Chun Pang	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20130710	ZigBee is a specification formalized by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for low-power low-cost low-data-rate wireless personal area networks. In ZigBee networks, a tree topology is often used to construct a wireless sensor network for data delivery applications. However, delivery failures constantly occur in ZigBee wireless applications due to node movements and network topology changes. The conventional route reconstruction method is designed to mitigate the effects of topology changes, but it consumes a large amount of resources. In this paper, we exploit the regularity in node mobility patterns to reduce the frequency of route reconstructions and ensure that the transmission of data to mobile nodes is efficient. To increase the data delivery ratio and mitigate the effects of packet loss caused by the node mobility, we propose a ZigBee node deployment and tree construction framework. In particular, the framework considers the regularity in mobility patterns during the construction of the routing tree and deployment of nodes. It also includes an overhearing mechanism for mobile nodes to further improve the data delivery ratio. We present details of the proposed algorithms for node deployment and tree construction in the framework. The effectiveness of network topologies constructed under the framework is demonstrated through comprehensive ns-2 simulations based on two real-world scenarios. The results show that our approach can construct ZigBee tree topologies with a high data delivery ratio and low routing overhead.

257	A Concise Introduction to Models and Methods for Automated Planning		A Concise Introduction to Models and Methods for Automated Planning	20140702	Planning is the model-based approach to autonomous behavior where the agent behavior is derived automatically from a model of the actions, sensors, and goals. The main challenges in planning are computational as all models, whether featuring uncertainty and feedback or not, are intractable in the worst case when represented in compact form. In this book, we look at a variety of models used in AI planning, and at the methods that have been developed for solving them. The goal is to provide a modern and coherent view of planning that is precise, concise, and mostly self-contained, without being shallow. For this, we make no attempt at covering the whole variety of planning approaches, ideas, and applications, and focus on the essentials. The target audience of the book are students and researchers interested in autonomous behavior and planning from an AI, engineering, or cognitive science perspective.

Multiple sensors are placed at different locations to ensure that the backscattered signal could be detected by at least one sensor no matter which direction the human subject faces. We design a hidden Markov model to infer the subject facing direction and his or her chest movement. We compare the performance of our proposed scheme on 15 human volunteers with the medical gold standard using respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) belts, and show that on average, our estimation is over 81% correlated with the measurements of a RIP belt system. Furthermore, in order to automatically differentiate between periods of normal and abnormal breathing patterns, we develop a change point detection algorithm based on perfect simulation techniques to detect changes in the subject's breathing. The feasibility of our proposed system is verified by both the simulation and experiment results.

263	An Efficient Approach to Solving Nonograms	I-Chen Wu; Der-Johng Sun; Lung-Ping Chen; Kan-Yueh Chen; Ching-Hua Kuo; Hao-Hua Kang; Hung-Hsuan Lin	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130911	A nonogram puzzle is played on a rectangular grid of pixels with clues given in the form of row and column constraints. The aim of solving a nonogram puzzle, an NP-complete problem, is to paint all the pixels of the grid in black and white while satisfying these constraints. This paper proposes an efficient approach to solving nonogram puzzles. We propose a fast dynamic programming (DP) method for line solving, whose time complexity in the worst case is O(kl) only, where the grid size is l�l and k is the average number of integers in one constraint, always smaller than l. In contrast, the time complexity for the best line-solving method in the past is O(kl2). We also propose some fully probing (FP) methods to solve more pixels before running backtracking. Our FP methods can solve more pixels than the method proposed by Batenburg and Kosters (before backtracking), while having a time complexity that is smaller than theirs by a factor of O(l). Most importantly, these FP methods provide useful guidance in choosing the next promising pixel to guess during backtracking. The proposed methods are incorporated into a fast nonogram solver, named LalaFrogKK. The program outperformed all the programs collected in webpbn.com, and also won both nonogram tournaments that were held at the 2011 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI 2011, Taiwan). We expect that the proposed FP methods can also be applied to solving other puzzles efficiently.

268	A Discrete Point Estimate Method for Probabilistic Load Flow Based on the Measured Data of Wind Power	Xiaomeng Ai; Jinyu Wen; Tong Wu; Wei-Jen Lee	Industry Applications, IEEE Transactions on	20130916	Probabilistic load flow (LF) calculation is the first step to evaluate the potential impact of the integrated wind power on the power system. Although research works show that the wind speed can be modeled by a Weibull probability density function (pdf), due to the nonlinear relationship between the wind speed and the wind power as well as many other influencing factors, it is hard to fit wind power to any common pdfs. At the same time, the relationship between the input and output variables of LF calculation is nonlinear. In view of the two characteristics, the point estimate method and Gram-Charlier expansion method are combined. Based only on the sample data of the wind power, the expectation, variance, and cumulative distribution of the output random variables can be estimated with the method by 2n + 1 times of LF calculation, where n is the number of input stochastic variables, eliminating the need for the distribution of the input variables. The simulation results on the New England Test System and New York Power Pool (NETS-NYPP) system and the actual Northeast China Grid show that the proposed method provides higher precision with less computation burden. The method can also be applied to other problems with uncertainty factors whose distribution is unknown in the power system.

271	Research on dynamic load modelling based on power quality monitoring system	Ren-Feng Yuan; Qian Ai; Xing He	Generation, Transmission & Distribution, IET	20130325	This study proposes a novel approach for load modelling fulfilled in Guangdong Power Grid, Southern China. Dynamic load modelling lies on real-time data provided by load disturbances. These data can be acquired by power quality equipment fixed on each substation. This study introduces the approach to data processing and load modelling during asymmetric disturbance to solve the problems of insufficient inartificial disturbance data. In order to improve the global optimisation capability and identification efficiency in multi-dimensional function, an improved clone selection algorithm is proposed, which includes adaptive-adjust Gaussian mutation operators and the directional evolution mechanism, and also using the character of parameters independence between induction motor model and ZIP model referring to the third-order induction-motor paralleling ZIP model in BPA. The results of practical load modelling prove that the proposed algorithm has great effects on improving model precision and adaptability. Finally, the influences on power angle, frequency, voltage and power between dynamic load model and ZIP are discussed.

272	Scoliosis Follow-Up Using Noninvasive Trunk Surface Acquisition	Adankon, M.M.; Chihab, N.; Dansereau, J.; Labelle, H.; Cheriet, F.	Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20130715	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a musculoskeletal pathology. It is a complex spinal curvature in a 3-D space that also affects the appearance of the trunk. The clinical follow-up of AIS is decisive for its management. Currently, the Cobb angle, which is measured from full spine radiography, is the most common indicator of the scoliosis progression. However, cumulative exposure to X-rays radiation increases the risk for certain cancers. Thus, a noninvasive method for the identification of the scoliosis progression from trunk shape analysis would be helpful. In this study, a statistical model is built from a set of healthy subjects using independent component analysis and genetic algorithm. Based on this model, a representation of each scoliotic trunk from a set of AIS patients is computed and the difference between two successive acquisitions is used to determine if the scoliosis has progressed or not. This study was conducted on 58 subjects comprising 28 healthy subjects and 30 AIS patients who had trunk surface acquisitions in upright standing posture. The model detects 93% of the progressive cases and 80% of the nonprogressive cases. Thus, the rate of false negatives, representing the proportion of undetected progressions, is very low, only 7%. This study shows that it is possible to perform a scoliotic patient's follow-up using 3-D trunk image analysis, which is based on a noninvasive acquisition technique.	3-D trunk modeling;genetic algorithm;independent component analysis;pattern recognition;scoliosis;surface topography,Genetic algorithms;Principal component analysis;Surface reconstruction;Surface topography;Three-dimensional displays;Vectors,cancer;data acquisition;diagnostic radiography;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;independent component analysis;medical image processing;muscle;neurophysiology;orthopaedics;patient care;physiological models3-D trunk image analysis;AIS patients;Cobb angle;adolescent idiopathic scoliosis;cancers;clinical follow-up;complex spinal curvature;false negatives;full spine radiography;genetic algorithm;independent component analysis;musculoskeletal pathology;noninvasive trunk surface acquisition;statistical modelAlgorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Scoliosis;Sensitivity and Specificity;Torso

274	Channel allocation and relay selection scheme in relay-based networks	Wu Di; Zhu Gang; Ai Bo	Communications, China	20130422	It has been demonstrated that either Channel Allocation (CA) or Relay Selection (RS) can improve the performance in relaying networks separately. However, there is little work concerning their combination in multi-cell uplink scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the issue which considers the CA and RS to optimize the system transmission rate in an uplink scenario, while maintaining the resource distribution fairness among users. This is first formulated as an optimization problem for a linear cellular system, where the same frequency channels can be reused in different cells. Based on the link and co-channel interference conditions, two low-complexity CA and RS schemes are then proposed with different decomposition sequences. Finally, numerical results are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed CA and RS methods. Simulations results show that the proposed methods can yield significant improvements in system performance in terms of average sum rate.	channel allocation;linear network;optimization;relay selection,Channel allocation;Interference;Optimization;Relays;Resource management;Signal to noise ratio;Uplink,cellular radio;channel allocation;relay networks (telecommunication);wireless channelschannel allocation;frequency channels;linear cellular system;low-complexity CA scheme;low-complexity RS scheme;multi-cell uplink scenarios;numerical analysis;relay selection scheme;relay-based networks;resource distribution;transmission rate							
275	Three dimensional numerical study on the efficiency of a core-shell InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well nanowire light-emitting diodes	Li, Chi-Kang; Yang, Hung-Chih; Hsu, Ta-Cheng; Shen, Yu-Jiun; Liu, Ai-Sen; Wu, Yuh-Renn	Journal of Applied Physics	20130516	This paper presents the findings of investigating core-shell multiple quantum well nanowire light-emitting diodes (LEDs). A fully self-consistent three dimensional model that solves Poisson and drift-diffusion equations was employed to investigate the current flow and quantum-confined stark effect. The core-shell nanowire LED showed a weaker droop effect than that of conventional planar LEDs because of a larger active area and stronger recombination in nonpolar quantum wells (QWs). The current spreading effect was examined to determine the carrier distribution at the sidewall of core-shell nanowire LEDs. The results revealed that a larger aspect ratio by increasing the nanowire height could increase the nonpolar-active area volume and reduce the droop effect at the same current density. Making the current spreading length exceed a greater nanowire height is critical for using the enhancement of nonpolar QWs effectively, when an appropriate transparent conducting layer might be necessary. In addition, this paper presents a discussion on the influences of the spacing between each nanowire on corresponding nanowire diameters.

276	Characterisation and analysis of harmonic emissions in nonlinear bulk acoustic wave resonators	Shin, J.-S.; Song, I.; Ai, Y.; Hwang, S.; Rieh, J.-S.	Electronics Letters	20131104	Harmonic emissions of nonlinear bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators with their different configurations are demonstrated and analysed. With the anti-polarisation configuration of the piezoelectric resonators, the second harmonic emissions are dramatically reduced. However, the anti-series configuration of dual BAW resonators exhibits a sharp increase in second harmonic emissions near the anti-resonance frequency. By investigating the phase difference of the generated harmonic waves, the reason for that sharp increase has been successfully analysed.	bulk acoustic wave devices;harmonics;surface acoustic wave resonatorsantipolarisation configuration;antiresonance frequency;antiseries configuration;dual BAW resonators;generated harmonics waves;nonlinear bulk acoustic wave resonators;phase difference;piezoelectric resonators;second harmonics emissions							
277	Propagation channel measurements and analysis at 2.4 GHz in subway tunnels	Ruisi He; Zhangdui Zhong; Bo Ai; Ke Guan; Binghao Chen; AIonso, J.I.; Briso, C.	Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation, IET	20130826	The reliability of communication systems in a subway tunnel requires an absolute understanding of the propagation channel in this environment. From an insightful look at the subway channel and especially when compared with the other underground propagation environments such as mines, roads and railway tunnels, an important feature of the subway tunnel is the existence of stations in the tunnel. These stations cause extra reflection in the channel and also increase the delay spread observed. Although this effect has been largely neglected in available propagation channel literature, this is an important concept that ought to be explored. In this work, the authors present channel measurements conducted close to a station in a subway tunnel at 2.4 GHz, using a self-developed frequency domain channel sounder. To aid the authors analysis, three typical propagation regions are defined: line-of-sight (LOS), non-LOS and far-LOS, and also use a larger observation delay window to investigate the long delay clusters caused by the existence of stations in subway tunnel. From the analysis of the power delay profile (PDP), root-mean-square delay spread and scattering function in the three propagation regions, the authors have been able to infer a long delay cluster of about 2 ?s, which the authors attributed to multipath propagation of signal along the tunnel and reflections in the station. The Saleh-Valenzuela model is used to characterise the long clustering phenomenon observed in the PDP. The results show that the time spreading in subway tunnel is more significant because of the station compared with other underground tunnels, which leads to substantial signal distortion.

278	Coevolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization Using AIS and its Application in Multiparameter Estimation of PMSM	Zhao-Hua Liu; Jing Zhang; Shao-Wu Zhou; Xiao-Hua Li; Kan Liu	Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20131119	In this paper, a coevolutionary particle-swarm-optimization (PSO) algorithm associating with the artificial immune principle is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the whole population is divided into two kinds of subpopulations consisting of one elite subpopulation and several normal subpopulations. The best individual of each normal subpopulation will be memorized into the elite subpopulation during the evolution process. A hybrid method, which creates new individuals by using three different operators, is presented to ensure the diversity of all the subpopulations. Furthermore, a simple adaptive wavelet learning operator is utilized for accelerating the convergence speed of the pbest particles. The improved immune-clonal-selection operator is employed for optimizing the elite subpopulation, while the migration scheme is employed for the information exchange between elite subpopulation and normal subpopulations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by testing on a suite of standard benchmark functions, which shows faster convergence and global search ability. Its performance is further evaluated by its application to multiparameter estimation of permanent-magnet synchronous machines, which shows that its performance significantly outperforms existing PSOs. The proposed algorithm can estimate the machine dq-axis inductances, stator winding resistance, and rotor flux linkage simultaneously.

283	Incentive Learning in Monte Carlo Tree Search	Kuo-Yuan Kao; I-Chen Wu; Shi-Jim Yen; Yi-Chang Shan	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20131211	Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a search paradigm that has been remarkably successful in computer games like Go. It uses Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the values of nodes in a search tree. The node values are then used to select the actions during subsequent simulations. The performance of MCTS heavily depends on the quality of its default policy, which guides the simulations beyond the search tree. In this paper, we propose an MCTS improvement, called incentive learning, which learns the default policy online. This new default policy learning scheme is based on ideas from combinatorial game theory, and hence is particularly useful when the underlying game is a sum of games. To illustrate the efficiency of incentive learning, we describe a game named Heap-Go and present experimental results on the game.

Signal Processing Letters, IEEE	20130418	A hybrid active appearance model (AAM) called sequential AAM (SAAM) based on online instance learning is presented. The subspace of the subject-specific AAM component is initially learned with sequential registration results of first frames, and is periodically updated through incremental principal component analysis and online instance fitting process. A drift correction component of the AAM is also updated during tracking by selecting previous ﾑgood fittingﾒ frame as a reference image. With the model, facial features can be tracked in a video given theirs locations in the first frame and no other information. Experiments show improved fitting accuracy and computation cost compared with other state-of-the-art AAM.

285	On Scalability, Generalization, and Hybridization of Coevolutionary Learning: A Case Study for Othello	Szubert, M.; Jaskowski, W.; Krawiec, K.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130911	This study investigates different methods of learning to play the game of Othello. The main questions posed concern scalability of algorithms with respect to the search space size and their capability to generalize and produce players that fare well against various opponents. The considered algorithms represent strategies as n-tuple networks, and employ self-play temporal difference learning (TDL), evolutionary learning (EL) and coevolutionary learning (CEL), and hybrids thereof. To assess the performance, three different measures are used: score against an a priori given opponent (a fixed heuristic strategy), against opponents trained by other methods (round-robin tournament), and against the top-ranked players from the online Othello League. We demonstrate that although evolutionary-based methods yield players that fare best against a fixed heuristic player, it is the coevolutionary temporal difference learning (CTDL), a hybrid of coevolution and TDL, that generalizes better and proves superior when confronted with a pool of previously unseen opponents. Moreover, CTDL scales well with the size of representation, attaining better results for larger n-tuple networks. By showing that a strategy learned in this way wins against the top entries from the Othello League, we conclude that it is one of the best 1-ply Othello players obtained to date without explicit use of human knowledge.	$n$-tuple systems;Coevolution;Othello;temporal difference learning (TDL),Games;Heuristic algorithms;Search problems;Sociology;Statistics;Table lookup,game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);network theory (graphs)CTDL;Othello game;coevolutionary temporal difference learning;evolutionary learning;learning generalization;learning hybridization;learning scalability;n-tuple networks;round-robin game tournament;self-play temporal difference learning							
286	Mechanomyography Sensor Development, Related Signal Processing, and Applications: A Systematic Review	Islam, M.A.; Sundaraj, K.; Ahmad, R.B.; Ahamed, N.U.; Ali, M.A.	Sensors Journal, IEEE	20130606	Mechanomyography (MMG) is extensively used in the research of sensor development, signal processing, characterization of muscle activity, development of prosthesis and/or switch control, diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders, and as a medical rehabilitation tool. Despite much existing MMG research, there has been no systematic review of these. This paper aims to determine the current status of MMG in sensor development, related signal processing, and applications. Six electronic databases were extensively searched for potentially eligible studies published between 2003 and 2012. From a total of 175 citations, 119 were selected for full-text evaluation and 86 potential studies were identified for further analysis. This systematic review initially reveals that the development of accelerometers for MMG is still in the initial stage. Another important finding of this paper is that sensor placement location on muscles may influence the MMG signal. In addition, we observe that the majority of research processes MMG signals using wavelet transform. Time/frequency domain analysis of MMG signals provides useful information to examine muscle. In addition, we find that MMG may be applied to diagnose muscle conditions, to control prosthesis and/or switch devices, to assess muscle activities during exercises, to study motor unit activity, and to identify the type of muscle fiber. Finally, we find that the majority of the studies use accelerometers as sensors for MMG measurements. We also observe that currently MMG-based rehabilitation is still in a nascent stage. In conclusion, we recommend further improvements of MMG in the areas of sensor development, particularly on accelerometers, and signal processing aspects, as well as increasing future applications of the technique in prosthesis and/or switch control, clinical practices, and rehabilitation.

287	Electroencephalogram and Physiological Signal Analysis for Assessing Flow in Games	Berta, R.; Bellotti, F.; De Gloria, A.; Pranantha, D.; Schatten, C.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	Passive brain-computer interaction (BCI) can provide useful information to understand a user's state and anticipate intentions, which is needed to support adaptivity and personalization. Given the huge variety of audiences, a game's capability of adapting to different user profiles-in particular to keep the player in flow-is crucial to make it ever more enjoyable and satisfying. We have performed a user experiment exploiting a four-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) tool similar to the ones that are soon likely to appear in the market for game control. We have performed a spectral characterization of the video-gaming experience, also in comparison with other tasks. Results show that the most informative frequency bands for discriminating among gaming conditions are around low beta. Simple signals from the peripheral nervous system add marginal information. Classification of three levels of user states is possible, with good accuracy, using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A user-independent classification performs worse than a user-dependent approach (50.1% versus 66.4% rate). Personalized SVM training and validation time is reasonable (7-8 min). Thus, we argue that a personalized system could be implemented in a consumer context and research should aim at improving classifiers that can be trained online by end users.

288	Experiencing BCI Control in a Popular Computer Game	van de Laar, B.; Gurkok, H.; Plass-Oude Bos, D.; Poel, M.; Nijholt, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are not only being developed to aid disabled individuals with motor substitution, motor recovery, and novel communication possibilities, but also as a modality for healthy users in entertainment and gaming. This study investigates whether the incorporation of a BCI in the popular game World of Warcraft (WoW) has effects on the user experience. A BCI control channel based on parietal alpha band power is used to control the shape and function of the avatar in the game. In the experiment, participants (n=42) , a mix of experienced and inexperienced WoW players, played with and without the use of BCI in a within-subjects design. Participants themselves could indicate when they wanted to stop playing. Actual and estimated duration was recorded and questionnaires on presence and control were administered. Afterwards, oral interviews were taken. No difference in actual duration was found between conditions. Results indicate that the difference between estimated and actual duration was not related to user experience but was person specific. When using a BCI, control and involvement were rated lower. But BCI control did not significantly decrease fun. During interviews, experienced players stated that they saw potential in the application of BCIs in games with complex interfaces such as WoW. This study suggests that BCI as an additional control can be as much fun and natural to use as keyboard/mouse control, even if the amount of control is limited.

291	Preparation and phase structures of ZnﾖTiﾖO ternary compounds by atomic layer deposition	Qian, Xu; Gao, Mo-Yun; Cao, Yan-Qiang; Guo, Bing-Lei; Li, Ai-Dong	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films	20121203	ZnﾖTiﾖO (ZTO) ternary films with various Zn/Ti cycle ratios were deposited on Si substrates using diethylzinc and titanium isopropoxide as Zn and Ti sources by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The effect of Zn/Ti cycle ratio and postannealing temperature on the growth rate, composition, phase structure, and morphology of ZTO films were investigated by a series of analytical tools. It is found that for ALD ZTO films, the growth per cycle (GPC) of TiO2 deposited on ZnO-terminated surface is faster than that of pure TiO2, while the GPC of ZnO deposited on TiO2-terminated surface becomes slower than that of pure ZnO. This makes the Zn/Ti cycle ratio effect on the film composition become weak. The postannealing temperature and ALD sequence play important roles in facilitating the ZTO phase evolution. Pure Zn2TiO4 phase can be obtained in the (1:2)-ZTO films with 40.3 mol. % Ti content postannealed at 900 ﾰC. For (2:5)-ZTO samples with 48.8 mol. % Ti content, pure h-ZnTiO3 phase can be formed at 700 ﾰC. At 700 ﾰC and above, the rutile TiO2 phase appears for (1:3)-ZTO samples with 52.1 mol. % Ti content. The scanning electron microscopy images confirm with increasing the postannealing temperature; the grain size becomes large with the inhomogenous morphologic change due to the h-ZnTiO3 phase decomposition into Zn2TiO4 and rutile TiO2 phases.	atomic layer deposition;decomposition;grain size;materials preparation;organic compounds;scanning electron microscopy;solid-state phase transformations;thin films;zinc compounds6470K-;6855aj;8115Gh;8130Hd,							
292	Dual Voltage Supply Converter for High-Speed Doubly Salient Reluctance Motors	Elgendy, M.A.; Pickert, Volker; Zahawi, B.; Morton, C.; Ayob, A.	Power Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20120928	Small variable speed drives intended for mass-market applications like hand-held power tools and household appliances have to be inexpensive and efficient. Doubly salient reluctance motors are known to be cheap and robust, but their use in such mass market applications has been hindered by the cost and limitations of their associated power converters. A new converter concept is proposed in this paper. The new converter has the ability to apply higher voltages across the machine windings than could be obtained with standard circuits to achieve high-speed operation. The demagnetization of the machine coils is load independent ensuring fast current decay and consequently a stable high-speed operation at higher loads. The fast rate of current decay allows a longer duration of positive torque pulses resulting in less pulsating torque. A detailed analysis of the proposed converter is presented and design guidelines are laid out. A 1-kW prototype converter is designed and constructed to experimentally validate the operation of the new circuit.

293	Short-Term Fading Behavior in High-Speed Railway Cutting Scenario: Measurements, Analysis, and Statistical Models	Ruisi He; Zhangdui Zhong; Bo Ai; Jianwen Ding; Yaoqing Yang; Molisch, A.F.	Antennas and Propagation, IEEE Transactions on	20130403	Cuttings are widely used in high-speed railway (HSR) transportation to ensure the flatness of rails. The special structure of cuttings results in rich reflection and scattering, and creates dense multipath components. This paper presents a series of measurements of the propagation channel at 930 MHz conducted along the ﾓZhengzhou-Xi'anﾔ HSR of China, to characterize the small-scale fading behavior of rail-cutting scenarios as a function of the geometry of cuttings, including crown width and bottom width. Raw data are collected in six cuttings (five cuttings are used for developing the model, while the other one is used for validation) in rural and suburban environments. We propose a set of effective methods to statistically model the spatial/temporal variations - including fade depth (FD), level crossing rate (LCR), average fade duration (AFD), and Ricean K-factor - as a function of the structural parameters of cuttings. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)-based evaluation indicates that the Ricean distribution is the best to describe small-scale fading. In addition, the rich multipath and directionality of the transmitting antennas lead to a non-monotonous dependence of the K-factor on the distance between transmitter and receiver. The autocovariance function of the deviation of the extracted K -factors from the proposed model is presented and the coherence length is investigated. Our results show that even though a cutting is a scenario with severe fading, a ﾓwideﾔ cutting (i.e., with both wide crown and bottom widths) is conducive to the reduction of the severity of fading.	 ${K}$-factors;Cutting scenario;fading distribution;goodness-of-fit (GoF);high-speed railway (HSR);short-term fading behavior,Analytical models;Antenna measurements;Fading;Rail transportation;Rails;Receivers;Structural engineering,Rician channels;UHF antennas;UHF radio propagation;railway communication;statistical analysis;transmitting antennasAFD;Akaike information criterion-based evaluation;HSR transportation;LCR;Ricean K-factor;Ricean distribution;autocovariance function;average fade duration;fade depth;frequency 930 MHz;high-speed railway cutting scenario;level crossing rate;multipath components;propagation channel;receiver;short-term fading behavior;small-scale fading behavior;statistical models;transmitter;transmitting antennas							
294	A Novel Fault Diagnostics and Prediction Scheme Using a Nonlinear Observer With Artificial Immune System as an Online Approximator	Thumati, B.T.; Halligan, G.R.	Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20130417	In this paper, an observer-based fault diagnostics and prediction (FDP) scheme for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems via output measurements is introduced by using artificial immune system (AIS) and a robust adaptive term. Traditionally, AIS was considered as an offline tool for system identification and pattern recognition whereas here AIS is utilized as an online approximator in discrete-time (OLAD) in a fault detection (FD) observer. A fault is detected when the output residual exceeds a predefined threshold. Upon detection, the OLAD is initiated to learn the unknown fault dynamics online while the robust adaptive term ensure asymptotic convergence of the output residual for a state fault whereas a bounded result for an output fault. Additionally, a mathematical equation is introduced to estimate the time-to-failure (TTF) by using the output residual and the estimated fault parameters. Finally, the performance of the proposed FDP scheme is demonstrated on an axial piston pump hardware test-bed.

295	Thinking Penguin: Multimodal BrainﾖComputer Interface Control of a VR Game	Leeb, R.; Lancelle, M.; Kaiser, V.; Fellner, D.W.; Pfurtscheller, G.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	In this paper, we describe a multimodal brain-computer interface (BCI) experiment, situated in a highly immersive CAVE. A subject sitting in the virtual environment controls the main character of a virtual reality game: a penguin that slides down a snowy mountain slope. While the subject can trigger a jump action via the BCI, additional steering with a game controller as a secondary task was tested. Our experiment profits from the game as an attractive task where the subject is motivated to get a higher score with a better BCI performance. A BCI based on the so-called brain switch was applied, which allows discrete asynchronous actions. Fourteen subjects participated, of which 50% achieved the required performance to test the penguin game. Comparing the BCI performance during the training and the game showed that a transfer of skills is possible, in spite of the changes in visual complexity and task demand. Finally and most importantly, our results showed that the use of a secondary motor task, in our case the joystick control, did not deteriorate the BCI performance during the game. Through these findings, we conclude that our chosen approach is a suitable multimodal or hybrid BCI implementation, in which the user can even perform other tasks in parallel.

The T/R-R bistatic radar is proposed to solve this problem. First, the bistatic geometry and bistatic echo signals of a spinning target are modeled. Then, a novel 2-D imaging algorithm is presented based on the connections between the mono- and bistatic echoes of the same scatterer and the classical Hough transform, allowing both the mono- and bistatic 2-D images of the spinning target to be obtained simultaneously. The theoretical analysis is carried out by the electromagnetic calculation and numerical simulations.	2-D imaging;Bistatic radar;Hough transform (HT);spinning target,Bistatic radar;Doppler effect;Imaging;Radar imaging;Receivers;Spinning,Hough transforms;geometry;numerical analysis;radar imaging2D spinning target imaging;Hough transform;bistatic echo;bistatic echo signal;bistatic geometry;electromagnetic calculation;line of sight radar;monostatic echo;monostatic radar;narrow-band T-R-R bistatic radar;numerical simulation;spinning axis angle

301	Rminimax: An Optimally Randomized MINIMAX Algorithm	Di&#x0301;ez, S.G.; Laforge, J.; Saerens, M.	Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20130117	This paper proposes a simple extension of the celebrated MINIMAX algorithm used in zero-sum two-player games, called Rminimax. The Rminimax algorithm allows controlling the strength of an artificial rival by randomizing its strategy in an optimal way. In particular, the randomized shortest-path framework is applied for biasing the artificial intelligence (AI) adversary toward worse or better solutions, therefore controlling its strength. In other words, our model aims at introducing/implementing bounded rationality to the MINIMAX algorithm. This framework takes into account all possible strategies by computing an optimal tradeoff between exploration (quantified by the entropy spread in the tree) and exploitation (quantified by the expected cost to an end game) of the game tree. As opposed to other tree-exploration techniques, this new algorithm considers complete paths of a tree (strategies) where a given entropy is spread. The optimal randomized strategy is efficiently computed by means of a simple recurrence relation while keeping the same complexity as the original MINIMAX. As a result, the Rminimax implements a nondeterministic strength-adapted AI opponent for board games in a principled way, thus avoiding the assumption of complete rationality. Simulations on two common games show that Rminimax behaves as expected.

302	Toward Contextual SSVEP-Based BCI Controller: Smart Activation of Stimuli and Control Weighting	Legeny, J.; Viciana-Abad, R.; Lecuyer, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20130610	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are becaming more available to the general public, and have already been used to control applications such as computer games. One disadvantage is that they are not completely reliable. In order to increase BCI performances, some low-level adjustments can be made, such as signal processing, as well as high level adjustments such as modifying the controller paradigm. In this study, we explore a novel, context-dependant, approach for a steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI controller. This controller uses two kinds of behavior alternation: commands can be added and removed if their use is irrelevant to the context and the actions resulting from their activation can be weighted depending on the likeliness of the actual intention of the user. This controller has been integrated within a BCI computer game and its influence in performance and mental workload has been addressed through a pilot experiment. Preliminary results have shown a workload reduction and performance improvement with the context-dependent controller, while keeping the engagement levels untouched.

Based on rigorous electromagnetic theory and the boundary element method, numerical results reveal that focal properties of the designed DFMs are significantly improved through replacing the traditional equal-thickness model (ETM) with the proposed MITM, especially in the case of small f -numbers. In addition, the superiority of the MITM to the ETM is demonstrated in designs of the arrayed DFMs. For interference effect in the arrayed DFMs, we present new explanations.

307	Ultimate noise isolation in high-speed digital systems on packages and printed circuit boards	Choi, J.	Electronics Letters	20130613	A novel idea for ultimate noise isolation in high-speed digital systems on packages and printed circuit boards (PCBs) is presented. Ultimate noise isolation in high-speed digital systems on packages and PCBs can be achieved using the following concept: `a power island surrounded by a plurality of mixed alternating impedance electromagnetic bandgap (AI-EBG) structures-based power distribution network'. In this idea, the gap around the power island provides excellent isolation from DC to the first resonant frequency of the parallel plates in packages or in PCBs and mixed AI-EBG structures provide excellent isolation from around the first resonant frequency to a substantially infinite frequency. This novel structure is designed, fabricated, and measured, which demonstrates ultimate noise isolation capability in high-speed digital systems on packages and PCBs.	photonic band gap;printed circuits;system-on-packageAI-EBG structures;PCB;high-speed digital systems;high-speed digital systems on packages;mixed alternating impedance electromagnetic bandgap structures;parallel plates;power distribution network;power island;resonant frequency;ultimate noise isolation							
308	Architecture and Design Flow for a Highly Efficient Structured ASIC	Man-Ho Ho; Yan-Qing Ai; Chau, T.C.-P.; Yuen, S.C.L.; Chiu-Sing Choy; Leong, P.H.W.; Kong-Pang Pun	Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20130220	As fabrication process technology continues to advance, mask set costs have become prohibitively expensive. Structured application specific integrated circuits (sASICs) offer a middle ground in price and performance between ASICs and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) by sharing masks across different designs. In this paper, two sASIC architectures are proposed, the first being based on three-input lookup-tables, and the second on AOI22 gates. The sASICs are programmed using a standard-cell compatible design flow. They are customized using a minimum of three masks, i.e., two metals and one via. The area and delay of the sASIC are compared with ASICs and FPGAs. Results over a set of benchmark circuits show that our AOI22-based sASIC had an average of 1.76x/1.41x increase in area/delay compared to ASICs, a considerable improvement compared with the 26.56x/5.09x increase for FPGAs. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the best performance reported in the literature for a practical sASIC. A prototype using the sASIC was fabricated using a universal machine control 0.13-?m mixed-mode/RF process. It was fully verified using scan and functional tests, and used in a demonstration system.

312	Automated 3-D Animation From Snooker Videos With Information-Theoretical Optimization	Jiang, R.; Parry, M.L.; Legg, P.A.; Chung, D.H.S.; Griffiths, I.W.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20131211	Automated 3-D modeling from real sports videos can provide useful resources for visual design in sports-related computer games, saving a lot of effort in manual design of visual contents. However, image-based 3-D reconstruction usually suffers from inaccuracy caused by statistic image analysis. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretical scheme to minimize errors of automated 3-D modeling from monocular sports videos. In the proposed scheme, mutual information (MI) was exploited to compute the fitting scores of a 3-D model against the observed single-view scene, and the optimization of model fitting was carried out subsequently. With this optimization scheme, errors in model fitting were minimized without human intervention, allowing automated reconstruction of 3-D animation from consecutive monocular video frames at high accuracy. In our work, the Snooker videos were taken as our case study, balls were positioned in 3-D space from single-view frames, and 3-D animation was reproduced from real Snooker videos. Our experimental results validated that the proposed information-theoretical scheme can help attain better accuracy in the automated reconstruction of 3-D animation, and demonstrated that information-theoretical evaluation can be an effective approach for model-based reconstruction from single-view videos.	3-D animation;Automated 3-D modeling;computer game design;visual design,Cameras;Fitting;Games;Image reconstruction;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Videos,computer animation;computer games;image reconstruction;optimisation;statistical analysis;video signal processingautomated 3D animation;consecutive monocular video frames;image-based 3D reconstruction;information-theoretical optimization;model fitting;model-based reconstruction;mutual information;single-view scene;snooker videos;sports-related computer games;statistic image analysis							
313	Hole electrical transporting properties in organic-Si Schottky solar cell	Shen, Xiaojuan; Zhu, Yawen; Song, Tao; Lee, Shuit-Tong; Sun, Baoquan	Applied Physics Letters	20130708	In this work we investigated the hole electrical transporting properties effect on the organic-Si hybrid Schottky solar cells. By changing the post-annealing atmosphere of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) film, the power conversion efficiencies of the Schottky Si/PEDOT:PSS cell boosted from 6.40% in air to 9.33% in nitrogen. Current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, external quantum efficiency, and transient photovoltage measurements illustrated that the enhanced power conversion efficiency of the cell was ascribed to the increase in both conductivity and work function (WP) of PEDOT:PSS film. The increased conductivity reduced the series resistance (RS) within the cell, and the higher WP generated the larger built-in potential (Vbi) which resulted in the improvement of the open-circuit voltage. In addition, the decreased RS and enlarged Vbi were beneficial for the efficient charge transport/collection, contributing to the enhancement of the fill factor. Our results indicated that the conductivity as well as the WP of the hole transporting layer played an important role in the organic-Si Schottky solar cell.	polymer films;solar cells;work function7330+y;7361Ph;8840H-,

317	Evaluation of Multivariate Visualization on a Multivariate Task	Livingston, M.A.; Decker, J.W.; Zhuming Ai	Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on	20121008	Multivariate visualization techniques have attracted great interest as the dimensionality of data sets grows. One premise of such techniques is that simultaneous visual representation of multiple variables will enable the data analyst to detect patterns amongst multiple variables. Such insights could lead to development of new techniques for rigorous (numerical) analysis of complex relationships hidden within the data. Two natural questions arise from this premise: Which multivariate visualization techniques are the most effective for high-dimensional data sets? How does the analysis task change this utility ranking? We present a user study with a new task to answer the first question. We provide some insights to the second question based on the results of our study and results available in the literature. Our task led to significant differences in error, response time, and subjective workload ratings amongst four visualization techniques. We implemented three integrated techniques (Data-driven Spots, Oriented Slivers, and Attribute Blocks), as well as a baseline case of separate grayscale images. The baseline case fared poorly on all three measures, whereas Datadriven Spots yielded the best accuracy and was among the best in response time. These results differ from comparisons of similar techniques with other tasks, and we review all the techniques, tasks, and results (from our work and previous work) to understand the reasons for this discrepancy.

318	Some results on characteristics of bistatic high-range resolution profiles for target classification	Ai, X.; Li, Y.; Wang, X.; Xiao, S.	Radar, Sonar & Navigation, IET	20120604	This study focuses on the bistatic high-range resolution profiles (HRRPs) of high-speed and manoeuvring targets and considers how to utilise the length of the bistatic HRRP for target classification. The bistatic HRRP of a high-speed and manoeuvring target is obtained via stretch processing and motion compensation, and its distortion caused by target translation is analysed quantitatively. It is demonstrated that the distortion of bistatic HRRPs is quite different from the monostatic case. The conventional length of the bistatic HRRP cannot reflect the target length, as in the monostatic case, so a new length is defined - the bistatic bisector HRRP length - which corresponds to the length of the target-s projection on the bisector of the bistatic angle. Additionally, the sensitivity of the bistatic HRRP to the target aspect and location is discussed and the bistatic bisector HRRP length is proved to be applicable for target classification through computer simulation and electromagnetic calculation.	image classification;motion compensationbistatic high-range resolution profiles;computer simulation;electromagnetic calculation;high-speed target;manoeuvring target;motion compensation;stretch processing;target classification;target translation;target-s projection

The proposed model framework is generic and adaptable to multiple cooperative MIMO scenarios by simply adjusting key model parameters. Based on the proposed model framework and using a typical cooperative MIMO communication environment as an example, we derive a novel geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) applicable to multiple wireless propagation scenarios. The proposed GBSM is the first cooperative MIMO channel model that has the ability to investigate the impact of the local scattering density (LSD) on channel characteristics. From the derived GBSM, the corresponding multi-link spatial correlation functions are derived and numerically analyzed in detail.

Using this model and density functional theory, we calculated photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and PL spectra of intrinsic 3C-SiC, P-doped SiC and N-doped SiC. The violet or near ultraviolet PLE peaks were found to be observed in PLE spectra for Sin-1PCn and SinNCn-1 (n = 4, 8, 12, and 16). Compared to intrinsic 3C-SiC, doped 3C-SiC exhibits higher PL peaks which for P-doped SiC are in the indigo spectral region, near the 3C-SiCﾒs peak, and for N-doped SiC appear in the green. The phenomena are studied through analyses of band structure, carrier concentration, and absorption. For doped 3C-SiC, the PL properties are mainly improved by the band-gap transformation from indirect to direct and the increase in carrier concentration near the Fermi level.

In this paper, a new double-butterfly coil was proposed and a simulation model as well as an experimental setup was developed to validate the performance of the new stimulation coil. Focality of the double-butterfly coil was compared with that of the butterfly coil via both simulation and experiment method. It is showed that the focality of the proposed coil has better focality than the butterfly coil. The effects of structural parameters on the focality performance of the induced electrical field were carefully studied.

324	Cylindrical Surfaces Enable Wavelength-Selective Extinction and Sub-0.2 nm Linewidth in 250   -Gap Silicon Fabry�P�rot Cavities	Malak, M.; Marty, F.; Pavy, N.; Peter, Y.-A.; Ai-Qun Liu; Bourouina, T.	Microelectromechanical Systems, Journal of	20120202	In this paper, we propose two different designs of micromachined Fabry-Pe?rot optical cavities, with first motivation of improving the quality factor (Q -factor) and in the same time allowing increased cavity length L. Our approach consists of providing a solution to the main loss mechanism in conventional FP cavities related to the expansion of the Gaussian light beam after multiple reflections inside the cavity. The first design is based on all-silicon cylindrical Bragg mirrors, which provide 1-D confinement of light. In addition to wavelength selectivity, the first design also demonstrates its potential for a new class of applications, including wavelength selective extinction through mode-selective excitation, where the fiber-to-cavity distance is used as the control parameter. The second design is based on cylindrical Bragg mirrors combined with a fiber rod lens to provide a complete solution for 2-D confinement of light. This approach outperforms the first design in terms of Q-factor, of nearly 9000 for around 250 ?m-long cavity, which suggests its potential use for biochemical sensing and analysis as well as cavity enhancement applications requiring high Q.L values.

Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation, IET	20120709	This study describes an active inductor (AI) designed to reduce power consumption and to improve the quality factor. For these purposes, one of the transistors for the AI operates in the subthreshold region, and the AI uses the additive capacitor (AC) technique. The proposed AI was applied to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) to demonstrate the enhancement in power consumption and improvement in phase noise. The AI-VCOs with and without AC were fabricated using a 0.18 ?m CMOS process and achieved frequency tuning ranges from 1.13 to 2.67 GHz and 1.3 to 3.24 GHz, respectively. The measured phase noise of the AI-VCO with AC is -92.2 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, a 4 dB improvement compared to that of the AI-VCO without AC. The proposed VCO consumes 2.2-13 mW with a 1.8 V voltage supply and occupies 171 � 174 ?m2 of core size without testing pads.

X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy measurements reveal well-defined superstructures with smooth surface morphology. Magnetization and (magneto-)resistance of these [(LSMO)m/(BTO)n]5 superlattices are characterized as a function of the relative thickness m/n in each period. Saturated magnetization is observed to decrease as m/n decreases. The splitting in zero-field cooling/field cooling magnetization curves and the enhanced magnetoresistance imply the coexistence and the competition of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in the ultrathin LSMO layers due to a magnetic inhomogeneity along the direction perpendicular to the sample surface. The inhomogeneity and the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic competition can be tuned by residual strain in the superlattices through designing the relative thickness of LSMO and BTO.

327	References		The Soar Cognitive Architecture	20120904	In development for thirty years, Soar is a general cognitive architecture that integrates knowledge-intensive reasoning, reactive execution, hierarchical reasoning, planning, and learning from experience, with the goal of creating a general computational system that has the same cognitive abilities as humans. In contrast, most AI systems are designed to solve only one type of problem, such as playing chess, searching the Internet, or scheduling aircraft departures. Soar is both a software system for agent development and a theory of what computational structures are necessary to support human-level agents. Over the years, both software system and theory have evolved. This book offers the definitive presentation of Soar from theoretical and practical perspectives, providing comprehensive descriptions of fundamental aspects and new components. The current version of Soar features major extensions, adding reinforcement learning, semantic memory, episodic memory, mental imagery, and an appraisal-based model of emotion. This book describes details of Soar's component memories and processes and offers demonstrations of individual components, components working in combination, and real-world applications. Beyond these functional considerations, the book also proposes requirements for general cognitive architectures and explicitly evaluates how well Soar meets those requirements.								
328	Nonlinear companding transform technique for reducing PAPR of ODFM signals	Wang, Y.; Wang, L.-H.; Ge, J.-H.; Ai, B.	Consumer Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20120927	In this paper a novel nonlinear companding transform (NCT) scheme based on the inverse hyperbolic sine function is proposed for reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. By introducing the variable companding parameters and an inflexion point in the companding function, it enables more design flexibility and freedom in companding form so that an effective trade-off between the PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance can be offered. Moreover, the theoretical study reveals that, to approach a desired PAPR threshold, it is preferable for the proposed scheme to make the companding distortion as small as possible with appropriate selection of the companding parameters and forms. The analysis expressions regarding the achievable PAPR reduction, transform gain G, and signal attenuation factor are derived. Simulation results also demonstrate that this scheme can substantially outperform existing NCT techniques.

329	Hamiltonian-Based Clustering: Algorithms for Static and Dynamic Clustering in Data Mining and Image Processing	Casagrande, D.; Sassano, M.; Astolfi, A.	Control Systems, IEEE	20120719	The large amount of data available for analysis and management raises the need for defining, determining, and extracting meaningful information from the data. Hence in scientific, engineering, and economics studies, the practice of clustering data arises naturally when sets of data have to be divided into subgroups with the aim of possibly deducting common features for data belonging to the same subgroup. For instance, the innovation scoreboard [1] (see Figure 1) allows for the classification of the countries into four main clusters corresponding to the level of innovation defining the ﾓleaders,ﾔ the ﾓfollowers,ﾔ the ﾓtrailing,ﾔ and the ﾓcatching upﾔ countries. Many other disciplines may require or take advantage of a clustering of data, from market research [2] to gene expression analysis [3], from biology to image processing [4][7]. Therefore, several clustering techniques have been developed (for details see ﾓReview of Clustering Algorithmsﾔ).	,Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Gene expressoin;Marketresearch;Technological innovation,data analysis;data mining;image processing;information retrieval;pattern clusteringHamiltonian-based clustering;biology;data analysis;data clustering;data management;data mining;dynamic clustering;gene expression analysis;image processing;information extraction;innovation scoreboard;market research;static clustering							
330	AIS-Based Coordinated and Adaptive Control of Generator Excitation Systems for an Electric Ship	Chuan Yan; Venayagamoorthy, G.K.; Corzine, K.	Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20120403	An artificial immune system (AIS)-based control of generator excitation systems for the U.S. Navy's electric ship is presented in this paper to solve power quality problems caused by high-energy loads such as direct energy weapons. The coordinated development of the AIS controllers mainly consists of two parts-innate immunity (optimal) and adaptive immunity. The parameters of the controllers for the former, to provide optimal performance, are determined simultaneously using particle swarm optimization. For dramatic changes in the ship's power system, adaptive control based on the immune system feedback law is developed. The feedback law adapts the controllers' parameters only during transient disturbances. After the disturbance, the controllers' parameters are restored to their innate values. A ship's real-time power system and the proposed AIS control of all excitation systems have been implemented on a real-time digital simulator and a digital signal processor, respectively. Results from the hardware-in-the-loop studies show that the AIS controllers can provide effective control of all generators' terminal voltages during pulsed loads, restoring and stabilizing them quickly.

Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20121129	Given the current level of international interest in game theory and its applications in AI and computer science, it seems worth pausing to consider whether game theory actually works. This article considers the evidence available in support of the two most common interpretations of game theory: the descriptive interpretation, which considers game theory as trying to predict actual behavior, and the normative interpretation, which considers game theory as providing advice on how to act optimally.	behavioral economics;descriptive game theory;effectiveness of game theory;game theory;normative game theory,Artificial intelligence;Behavioral science;Game theory,artificial intelligence;game theoryAI;computer science;game theory

Communications, IET	20120409	In distributed antenna systems (DAS), multi-user interference was shown to be asynchronous, which had not been paid much attention. In this study, the authors compare the performances of the DAS under the condition of asynchronous interference (AI) with four well-known multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) algorithms namely zero-forcing (ZF), block diagonalisation (BD), signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) and dirty paper coding (DPC) algorithms. The simulation results clearly demonstrate significant performance degradations of these algorithms. To further improve the performance under the condition of AI, this study presents an improved BD algorithm and a significant improvement is shown through corresponding simulation results.

Micro & Nano Letters, IET	20120409	Turbulent flow convective heat transfer and friction factor characteristics of Al2O3/water nanofluid flowing inside a uniformly heated horizontal circular tube are conducted in this Letter. To do this, Al2O3 nanoparticles of 40 nm size were characterised and dispersed in distilled water to form stable suspension containing 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 volume concentrations of nanofluids. Results indicate that heat transfer coefficients increase with nanofluid volume concentration and do not change with Reynolds number. The enhancement of the Nusselt number is about 22 at Re 13 500 using 2 alumina nanoparticles compared to distilled water. Experimental results are also compared with the existing correlations of convective heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop in turbulent regime. The measured pressure loss when using nanofluids is almost equal to that of the base fluid.	alumina;convection;friction;nanofluidics;nanoparticles;pipe flow;suspensions;turbulence;waterAl2O3-H2O;Nusselt number;Reynolds number;alumina nanoparticles;dispersed system;distilled water;friction factor;nanofluid volume concentration;nanoparticles;pressure drop;pressure loss;size 40 nm;stable suspension;turbulent flow convective heat transfer;uniformly heated horizontal circular tube;water nanofluid

It has also been shown that these two types of bifurcation may interact, giving rise to interesting dynamical phenomena. In this paper we show that in a current mode controlled dc-dc converter, periodic, quasi-periodic, and saturation behavior can coexist for the same parameter value, and there can be complex interactions between them. Furthermore, abrupt exit to saturation mode can be triggered by a torus-torus collision. Finally, we report the first observation of three-frequency quasi-periodicity in a power electronic system.

337	Computational Modeling of Narrative		Computational Modeling of Narrative	20140702	The field of narrative (or story) understanding and generation is one of the oldest in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), which is hardly surprising, since storytelling is such a fundamental and familiar intellectual and social activity. In recent years, the demands of interactive entertainment and interest in the creation of engaging narratives with life-like characters have provided a fresh impetus to this field. This book provides an overview of the principal problems, approaches, and challenges faced today in modeling the narrative structure of stories. The book introduces classical narratological concepts from literary theory and their mapping to computational approaches. It demonstrates how research in AI and NLP has modeled character goals, causality, and time using formalisms from planning, case-based reasoning, and temporal reasoning, and discusses fundamental limitations in such approaches. It proposes new representations for embedded narrati es and fictional entities, for assessing the pace of a narrative, and offers an empirical theory of audience response. These notions are incorporated into an annotation scheme called NarrativeML. The book identifies key issues that need to be addressed, including annotation methods for long literary narratives, the representation of modality and habituality, and characterizing the goals of narrators. It also suggests a future characterized by advanced text mining of narrative structure from large-scale corpora and the development of a variety of useful authoring aids. This is the first book to provide a systematic foundation that integrates together narratology, AI, and computational linguistics. It can serve as a narratology primer for computer scientists and an elucidation of computational narratology for literary theorists. It is written in a highly accessible manner and is intended for use by a broad scientific audience that includes linguists (computational and formal semanticist ), AI researchers, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, game developers, and narrative theorists.

339	An Efficient Nonlinear Companding Transform for Reducing PAPR of OFDM Signals	Wang, Y.; Wang, L.-H.; Ge, J.-H.; Ai, B.	Broadcasting, IEEE Transactions on	20121116	In this paper, an efficient nonlinear companding scheme is proposed to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. By transforming the statistics of original signals into a specified distribution form along with remaining an unchanged average output power level, this scheme can achieve significant reduction in PAPR as well as an improved BER performance simultaneously. Moreover, by properly adjusting the transform parameters, more design flexibility in companding form can also be given by this scheme to satisfy various system requirements. The theoretical analysis results regarding the transform gain, companding distortion and the selection criteria of parameters are derived. It is proved that this scheme may lead to less signal distortion compared to existing companding schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can substantially offer better overall performance of OFDM system in terms of PAPR reduction, BER performance and bandwidth efficiency.

340	Continuous Recognition of Player's Affective Body Expression as Dynamic Quality of Aesthetic Experience	Savva, N.; Scarinzi, A.; Bianchi-Berthouze, N.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120911	The emergence of full-body computer games raises an interesting question: Can body movement be used to measure the aesthetic experience of players? In this paper, we aim to take a first step toward answering this question. Such a question emerges from the fact that various studies have shown the dual role of body movement, i.e., a window on people's emotional and mental states as well as a means to affect people's cognitive and affective processes. In this paper, first, we investigate the possibility of automatically recognizing the emotional expressions conveyed by the player's body movement in a Nintendo sport game. Our results showed that our automatic recognition system achieved recognition rates comparable to human observers' benchmarks. Second, by taking a pragmatist definition of aesthetic experience into account, we argue that the tracked body expressions do not only express what the player may be feeling. Given their modulating role on cognition and affect, these body expressions also let the player actively construct and assign affective meanings to the unfolding of the game. We argue that the player's variety of emotional bodily expressions constitutes the emotional rhythmic dynamic of aesthetic experience and, as such, they provide a measure of its distinctive quality.

Applied Physics Letters	20120305	This paper reports optical-force-induced bistability in a nanomachined ring resonator system. It consists of two ring resonators and a bus waveguide, whereby each ring resonator has a free-hanging arc that is perpendicularly deformable by an optical force and changes the effective refractive index of the system. Therefore, an optical bistability is induced into the nanomachined ring resonator system, in which the bistability band can reach 0.3 nm and 0.68 nm in the ring resonators 1 and 2, respectively. It has potential applications in optical signal processing area, such as all-optical switching and opto-mechanical memory.	micromechanical resonators;optical bistability;refractive index4265Pc;4279Gn;8585+j,							
342	Tracking Mobile Users in Wireless Networks via Semi-Supervised Colocalization	Pan, J.J.; Pan, S.J.; Jie Yin; Ni, L.M.; Qiang Yang	Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on	20120123	Recent years have witnessed the growing popularity of sensor and sensor-network technologies, supporting important practical applications. One of the fundamental issues is how to accurately locate a user with few labeled data in a wireless sensor network, where a major difficulty arises from the need to label large quantities of user location data, which in turn requires knowledge about the locations of signal transmitters or access points. To solve this problem, we have developed a novel machine learning-based approach that combines collaborative filtering with graph-based semi-supervised learning to learn both mobile users' locations and the locations of access points. Our framework exploits both labeled and unlabeled data from mobile devices and access points. In our two-phase solution, we first build a manifold-based model from a batch of labeled and unlabeled data in an offline training phase and then use a weighted k-nearest-neighbor method to localize a mobile client in an online localization phase. We extend the two-phase colocalization to an online and incremental model that can deal with labeled and unlabeled data that come sequentially and adapt to environmental changes. Finally, we embed an action model to the framework such that additional kinds of sensor signals can be utilized to further boost the performance of mobile tracking. Compared to other state-of-the-art systems, our framework has been shown to be more accurate while requiring less calibration effort in our experiments performed on three different testbeds.

343	Spectral efficient impulse radio-ultra-wideband transmission model in presence of pulse attenuation and timing jitter	Panahi, F.H.; Falahati, A.	Communications, IET	20121008	This study investigates the spectrum shaping observed in ultra-wideband (UWB) communications. An auxiliary independent signal (AIS) to limit undesired spectral lines because of periodicity or unbalanced data sources (i.e. non-uniformly distributed) and or non-symmetric data modulation schemes are introduced. Each transmitted symbol is represented by a preamble AIS pulse followed by a set of transmitted data pulses that are weighted, delayed and summed in accordance with a predefined modulation. The use of the fifth derivative Gaussian pulse ensures that the UWB spectrum mask established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is met, and a preamble signal is designed to eliminate spectral lines at specific frequencies that appear mainly by existing balanced or unbalanced binary data sources. A unified spectral analysis is adapted for general uncorrelated and correlated quaternary bi-orthogonal modulations. An optimisation problem is also introduced in the case of unbalanced data sources in order to minimise undesired spectral lines subject to comply with the FCC spectrum mask and maximise spectral utilisation.	timing jitter;ultra wideband communicationFCC spectrum mask;Federal Communications Commission;UWB communication;UWB spectrum mask;auxiliary independent signal;fifth-derivative Gaussian pulse;general correlated quaternary bi-orthogonal modulation;general uncorrelated quaternary bi-orthogonal modulations;nonsymmetric data modulation scheme;optimisation problem;preamble AIS pulse;preamble signal;pulse attenuation;spectral line elimination;spectral utilisation maximisation;spectral-efficient impulse radio-ultrawideband transmission model;spectrum shaping;timing jitter;transmitted data pulses;transmitted symbol;unbalanced binary data sources;undesired spectral line minimisation;unified spectral analysis

348	Uplink Channel Estimation for Multiuser Fiber-Wireless Systems Using Ternary Signals	Ng, Y.H.; Chuah, T.C.; Tan, A.H.	Communications Letters, IEEE	20121015	Channel estimation in fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) systems is more challenging compared to conventional communication systems as multipath dispersion introduced by the wireless channel is coupled with nonlinear distortion caused by the radio-over-fiber link. In a multiuser environment, multiple access interference (MAI) poses another challenge as it can significantly degrade system performance. A novel scheme to estimate multiuser Fi-Wi uplink channel using uncorrelated ternary pseudo-random signals is proposed. By exploiting proper harmonic suppression through signal design, the effects of nonlinear distortion and MAI can be eliminated or reduced.

349	AntBot: Ant Colonies for Video Games	Recio, G.; Martin, E.; Estebanez, C.; Saez, Y.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20121211	The video game industry is an emerging market which continues to expand. From its early beginning, developers have focused mainly on sound and graphical applications, paying less attention to developing game bots or other kinds of nonplayer characters (NPCs). However, recent advances in artificial intelligence offer the possibility of developing game bots which are dynamically adjustable to several difficulty levels as well as variable game environments. Previous works reveal a lack of swarm intelligence approaches to develop these kinds of agents. Considering the potential of particle swarm optimization due to its emerging properties and self-adaptation to dynamic environments, further investigation into this field must be undertaken. This research focuses on developing a generic framework based on swarm intelligence, and in particular on ant colony optimization, such as it allows general implementation of real-time bots that work over dynamic game environments. The framework has been adapted to allow the implementation of intelligent agents for the classical game Ms. Pac-Man.

351	Bayesian-Game-Based Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning Control for Decentralized POMDPs	Sharma, R.; Spaan, M.T.J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20121211	This paper proposes a Bayesian-game-based fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL) controller for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs). Dec-POMDPs have recently emerged as a powerful platform for optimizing multiagent sequential decision making in partially observable stochastic environments. However, finding exact optimal solutions to a Dec-POMDP is provably intractable (NEXP-complete), necessitating the use of approximate/suboptimal solution approaches. This approach proposes an approximate solution by employing fuzzy inference systems (FISs) in a game-based RL setting. It uses the powerful universal approximation capability of fuzzy systems to compactly represent a Dec-POMDP as a fuzzy Dec-POMDP, allowing the controller to progressively learn and update an approximate solution to the underlying Dec-POMDP. The proposed controller envisages an FIS-based RL controller for Dec-POMDPs modeled as a sequence of Bayesian games (BGs). We implement the proposed controller for two scenarios: 1) Dec-POMDPs with free communication between agents; and 2) Dec-POMDPs without communication. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach on three standard benchmark problems: 1) multiagent tiger; 2) multiaccess broadcast channel; and 3) recycling robot. Simulation results and comparative evaluation against other Dec-POMDP solution approaches elucidate the effectiveness and feasibility of employing FIS-based game-theoretic RL for designing Dec-POMDP controllers.

352	Design of Adaptive Autoreclosure Schemes for 132 kV Network With High Penetration of WindﾗPart I: Real-Time Modeling	Le Blond, S.P.; Aggarwal, R.K.	Power Delivery, IEEE Transactions on	20120620	This paper is the first of a series of publications detailing the development of an AI-based adaptive autoreclosing (AA) algorithm. In part 1, a detailed model of the Scottish 132 kV network has been constructed on a real-time digital simulator. The system model is discussed, including the network topology, line and source modeling, and the doubly fed induction generator-based wind farm model. An initial investigation on the penetration of harmonics from local wind farms is conducted using short circuit faults on two transmission lines in the network. This is necessary to ascertain to what extent wind farms may interfere with the AA scheme. Along with validating the model, the results suggest that penetration of harmonics is only significant on lines adjacent to the wind farms.

354	Distributed Throughput Optimization for ZigBee Cluster-Tree Networks	Yu-Kai Huang; Ai-Chun Pang; Pi-Cheng Hsiu; Weihua Zhuang; Pangfeng Liu	Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20120202	ZigBee, a unique communication standard designed for low-rate wireless personal area networks, has extremely low complexity, cost, and power consumption for wireless connectivity in inexpensive, portable, and mobile devices. Among the well-known ZigBee topologies, ZigBee cluster-tree is especially suitable for low-power and low-cost wireless sensor networks because it supports power saving operations and light-weight routing. In a constructed wireless sensor network, the information about some area of interest may require further investigation such that more traffic will be generated. However, the restricted routing of a ZigBee cluster-tree network may not be able to provide sufficient bandwidth for the increased traffic load, so the additional information may not be delivered successfully. In this paper, we present an adoptive-parent-based framework for a ZigBee cluster-tree network to increase bandwidth utilization without generating any extra message exchange. To optimize the throughput in the framework, we model the process as a vertex-constraint maximum flow problem, and develop a distributed algorithm that is fully compatible with the ZigBee standard. The optimality and convergence property of the algorithm are proved theoretically. Finally, the results of simulation experiments demonstrate the significant performance improvement achieved by the proposed framework and algorithm over existing approaches.

356	Adapting Models of Visual Aesthetics for Personalized Content Creation	Liapis, A.; Yannakakis, G.N.; Togelius, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120911	This paper introduces a search-based approach to personalized content generation with respect to visual aesthetics. The approach is based on a two-step adaptation procedure where: 1) the evaluation function that characterizes the content is adjusted to match the visual aesthetics of users; and 2) the content itself is optimized based on the personalized evaluation function. To test the efficacy of the approach, we design fitness functions based on universal properties of visual perception, inspired by psychological and neurobiological research. Using these visual properties, we generate aesthetically pleasing 2-D game spaceships via neuroevolutionary constrained optimization and evaluate the impact of the designed visual properties on the generated spaceships. The offline generated spaceships are used as the initial population of an interactive evolution experiment in which players are asked to choose spaceships according to their visual taste: the impact of the various visual properties is adjusted based on player preferences and new content is generated online based on the updated computational model of visual aesthetics of the player. Results are presented that show the potential of the approach in generating content which is based on subjective criteria of visual aesthetics.

359	Introducing Individual and Social Learning Into Evolutionary Checkers	Al-Khateeb, B.; Kendall, G.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20121211	In recent years, much research attention has been paid to evolving self-learning game players. Fogel's Blondie24 is just one demonstration of a real success in this field and it has inspired many other scientists. In this paper, evolutionary neural networks, evolved via an evolution strategy, are employed to evolve game-playing strategies for the game of Checkers. In addition, we introduce an individual and social learning mechanism into the learning phase of this evolutionary Checkers system. The best player obtained is tested against an implementation of an evolutionary Checkers program, and also against a player, which has been evolved within a round robin tournament. The results are promising and demonstrate that using individual and social learning enhances the learning process of the evolutionary Checkers system and produces a superior player compared to what was previously possible.

360	Accuracy improvement of SINS based on IMU rotational motion	Wei Sun; Ai-Gong Xu; Li-Na Che; Yang Gao	Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, IEEE	20121011	The SINS with IMU rotated is the high performances position measurement system based on the fiber optic gyroscopes. We have presented a theoretical and experimental study of the IMU rotation. Several experiments have proven that the combination of the SINS with IMU rotation achieves very high performance. SINS size and weight make it particularly suitable as the position measurement system of the small vehicles for which precise position with meter or sub-meter level is a critical issue. The experimental results showed that, the position errors which are calculated by SINS with IMU rotation, are much less than IMU static. Where, the position error which is caused by IMU double-axis rotation is 1.47 nm, which is much less than IMU single-axis rotation 6.06 nm. Therefore, the proposed position determination method is highly beneficial in providing accurate position of vehicle for several navigation applications, such as Missile boat and helicopter take off and landing platform on the aircraft carrier, etc.	,Accuracy;Aerospace control;Aircraft navigation;Navigation;Rotation measurement;Sensors,aircraft navigation;fibre optic gyroscopes;inertial navigation;position measurementIMU double-axis rotation motion;IMU single-axis rotation;SINS;aircraft carrier;fiber optic gyroscope;helicopter;missile boat;navigation application;position determination method;position error;position measurement system;size 1.47 nm;size 6.06 nm;submeter level

362	A Row-Parallel 8  8 2-D DCT Architecture Using Algebraic Integer-Based Exact Computation	Madanayake, A.; Cintra, R.J.; Onen, D.; Dimitrov, V.S.; Rajapaksha, N.; Bruton, L.T.; Edirisuriya, A.	Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20120531	An algebraic integer (AI)-based time-multiplexed row-parallel architecture and two final reconstruction step (FRS) algorithms are proposed for the implementation of bivariate AI encoded 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT). The architecture directly realizes an error-free 2-D DCT without using FRSs between row-column transforms, leading to an 8 � 8 2-D DCT that is entirely free of quantization errors in AI basis. As a result, the user-selectable accuracy for each of the coefficients in the FRS facilitates each of the 64 coefficients to have its precision set independently of others, avoiding the leakage of quantization noise between channels as is the case for published DCT designs. The proposed FRS uses two approaches based on: 1) optimized Dempster-Macleod multipliers, and 2) expansion factor scaling. This architecture enables low-noise high-dynamic range applications in digital video processing that requires full control of the finite-precision computation of the 2-D DCT. The proposed architectures and FRS techniques are experimentally verified and validated using hardware implementations that are physically realized and verified on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. Six designs, for 4-bit and 8-bit input word sizes, using the two proposed FRS schemes, have been designed, simulated, physically implemented, and measured. The maximum clock rate and block rate achieved among 8-bit input designs are 307.787 MHz and 38.47 MHz, respectively, implying a pixel rate of 8 � 307.787?2.462 GHz if eventually embedded in a real- time video-processing system. The equivalent frame rate is about 1187.35Hz for the image size of 1920 � 1080. All implementations are functional on a Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T FPGA device.

For the optimization of the number of neurons in the hidden layer, a new term based on the output of the hidden layer is added to the cost function as a penalty term to make optimal use of hidden units related to weights corresponding to each unit in the hidden layer. VSS is used to control the dynamic model of the training process, whereas EBP attempts to minimize the cost function. In addition to the analysis of the imposed dynamics of the EBP technique, the global stability of the mixed training methodology and constraints on the design parameters are considered. The advantages of the proposed technique are guaranteed convergence, improved robustness, and lower sensitivity to initial weights of the neural network.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120911	As video games have grown from crude and simple circuit-based artefacts to a multibillion dollar worldwide industry, video-game music has become increasingly adaptive. Composers have had to use new techniques to avoid the traditional, event-based approach where music is composed mostly of looped audio tracks, which can lead to music that is too repetitive. In addition, these cannot scale well in the design of today's games, which have become increasingly complex and nonlinear in narrative. This paper outlines the use of experience-driven procedural music generation, to outline possible ways forward in the dynamic generation of music and audio according to user gameplay metrics.

370	Index		The Machine Question:Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics	20121008	"One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the ""animal question""--consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the ""machine question"": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world."								
371	Tracking and Understanding Unknown Surface With High Speed by Force Sensing and Control for Robot	Yin, Y.H.; Yong Xu; Jiang, Z.H.; Wang, Q.R.	Sensors Journal, IEEE	20120801	Robot's blind tracking of an unknown surface with high speed is a critical problem of force control, to avoid damage to breakable objects, such as a bulb. It must deal with a typical action-based intelligence directly from force sensing to action in robot tracking and understanding of unknown external environments. Bio-inspired by human finger tracking, the realization of high-speed tracking relies on the real-time understanding and prediction of surface tendency, including the geometric feature and roughness. This paper presents an action-based intelligent frame for robot to track and understand an unknown surface with high speed using force sensing and control. The moving frame of force and position parallel control is built to obtain the differential geometric properties of an unknown surface. The motion trajectory is dynamically predicted by force sensing while tracking an unknown surface. A hybrid interpolator is developed to realize the parallel control of force and position. Moreover, a discriminant method for basic surface type recognition is investigated based on the normal curvature and geodesic torsion directly derived from the moving frame. The surface of revolution is further identified in the global understanding of unknown surface. The results of tracking a bulb with a desired contact force at a speed of 25 mm/s show the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent frame.

Antibody of AI binding on antigen-immobilized surface provides additional negative charge on underlap surface, and they give rise to channel potential increasing and result in drain current reduction.

The formation of Cu-Cu in AlN with the N vacancy (VN) is more energetically favorable than that without the VN. Hence, the Cu + VN state is produced easily.

Better movement systems will let robots function in a wider variety of settings than is currently feasible and also become more resilient when, for example, they are bumped or pushed. Several research projects are focusing on new types of robotic movement, as George Lawton describes in &#x201C;New Ways to Get Robots on the Move&#x201D;. In &#x201C;Researcher Uses AI to Analyze Human Genomes&#x201D;, Lawton writes how a researcher is using artficial intelligence to analyze human genomes.

380	Ensemble Determinization in Monte Carlo Tree Search for the Imperfect Information Card Game Magic: The Gathering	Cowling, P.I.; Ward, C.D.; Powley, E.J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20121211	In this paper, we examine the use of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for a variant of one of the most popular and profitable games in the world: the card game Magic: The Gathering (M:TG). The game tree for M:TG has a range of distinctive features, which we discuss here; it has incomplete information through the opponent's hidden cards and randomness through card drawing from a shuffled deck. We investigate a wide range of approaches that use determinization, where all hidden and random information is assumed known to all players, alongside MCTS. We consider a number of variations to the rollout strategy using a range of levels of sophistication and expert knowledge, and decaying reward to encourage play urgency. We examine the effect of utilizing various pruning strategies in order to increase the information gained from each determinization, alongside methods that increase the relevance of random choices. Additionally, we deconstruct the move generation procedure into a binary yes/no decision tree and apply MCTS to this finer grained decision process. We compare our modifications to a basic MCTS approach for M:TG using fixed decks, and show that significant improvements in playing strength can be obtained.

381	Fiber optic gyroscope for application at attitude determination systems	Wei Sun; Ai-Gong Xu; Yang Gao	Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, IEEE	20120523	The ADS is the high performance attitude measurement system based on FOGs. This has presented a theoretical and experimental study of an ADS prototype. Several experiments have proved that the attitude accuracy of ADS is similar with PHINS. Its size, weight, and power consumption make it particularly suitable as an attitude measurement system of small vehicles for which precise attitude is critical. The experimental results showed that level attitude errors which are proposed by ADS are 0.05ﾰ and the heading keeps consistent with PHINS. When the experiments are carried out respectively under the heading changed slowly and abruptly, the attitude errors are less than 0.1ﾰ. Therefore, the proposed attitude determination system is highly beneficial in providing accurate attitude of vehicles for several suburban geolocation and navigation applications [9].	,Gyroscopes;Navigation;Optical fibers;Optical imaging;Position measurement;Radio frequency,attitude measurement;fibre optic gyroscopes;inertial navigationADS;FOG;PHINS;attitude determination system;attitude errors;fiber optic gyroscope;navigation;suburban geolocation system							
382	An Improved Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm for the Beam Forming of Spaceborne SAR	Li Shi; Yun-Kai Deng; Hui-feng Sun; Wang, R.; Jia-qiu Ai; He Yan	Antennas and Propagation, IEEE Transactions on	20120529	An improved genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for beam forming of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which is equipped with active phased array antenna (APAA). The basic idea of the approach is that the phase and amplitude distributions of the element excitations can be represented by a few basis functions, as any functions can be expressed by a set of the complete orthogonal basis functions. Furthermore, by optimizing the weights of basis functions, the beam shaping and sidelobe notch can be achieved. In this algorithm, Legendre Polynomials (LP's), sine and cosine are utilized to define phase and amplitude distribution, respectively. Considering the difference between the transmitting and the receiving channels of T/R module, phase-only synthesis with uniform amplitude and complex excitation control are applied in the transmitting mode and the receiving mode, respectively. Based on the proposed algorithm, we achieved great reduction in the number of variables, obtained smoother curves of the phase and amplitude distributions and accelerated the convergence process, in comparison with conventional GA. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

384	Research on Erosion Property of Field-Distortion Gas Switch Electrode in Nanosecond Pulse	Hu Wang; Qiaogen Zhang; Jin Wei; Xuandong Liu; Aici Qiu	Plasma Science, IEEE Transactions on	20120606	Pulsed power technology is one of the technological foundations in high and new technology research, which has extremely broad development and application prospect. Gas switch is one of the key elements in pulsed power devices, and electrode erosion is a key restrictive factor in high-power gas switch development and application. According to the 1-D equation of heat conduction and thermal equilibrium equation near the electrode surface, this paper researches the electrode heat conduction mechanism, establishes the electrode erosion calculation model, calculates electrode erosion heat fluxes and their peak powers caused under different discharge conditions, and proceeds to calculate the depth of electrode etch pit. Calculation results indicate that arc joule heat is the main reason for electrode erosion when discharge current is not too high. In the light of different discharge parameters, that is, peak current, electric quantity, and current waveform, as well as single discharge electrode erosion experiments, the calculation formula of etch pit depth is fitted. The results indicate that model and fitted calculation results are relatively approximate to the experiment results.

385	An Integrated Approach to Automated Semantic Web Service Composition through Planning	Hatzi, Ourania; Vrakas, D.; Nikolaidou, Mara; Bassiliades, N.; Anagnostopoulos, Dimosthenis; Vlahavas, L.	Services Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20120823	The paper presents an integrated approach for automated semantic web service composition using AI planning techniques. An important advantage of this approach is that the composition process, as well as the discovery of the atomic services that take part in the composition, are significantly facilitated by the incorporation of semantic information. OWL-S web service descriptions are transformed into a planning problem described in a standardized fashion using PDDL, while semantic information is used for the enhancement of the composition process as well as for approximating the optimal composite service when exact solutions are not found. Solving, visualization, manipulation, and evaluation of the produced composite services are accomplished, while, unlike other systems, independence from specific planners is maintained. Implementation was performed through the development and integration of two software systems, namely PORSCE II and VLEPPO. PORSCE II is responsible for the transformation process, semantic enhancement, and management of the results. VLEPPO is a general-purpose planning system used to automatically acquire solutions for the problem by invoking external planners. A case study is also presented to demonstrate the functionality, performance, and potential of the approach.

For wavelength selection, a fixed etalon is employed to provide the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) grid with the 50-GHz spacing and a lead zirconate titanate-actuated tunable filter to select one ITU mode to resonate. The laser device measures a linewidth of 7 kHz, an output power of 14 dBm, a sidemode suppression ratio (SMSR) 55 dB, a tuning range 40 nm, and a response speed 2 ms. The superior performance well demonstrates the advantages of external cavity construction for the narrow-linewidth tunable lasers and may find applications in the emerging digital coherent communications.

387	Congestion Control With Multipacket Feedback	Qazi, I. A.; Andrew, L. L. H.; Znati, T.	Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on	20121213	Many congestion control protocols use explicit feedback from the network to achieve high performance. Most of these either require more bits for feedback than are available in the IP header or incur performance limitations due to inaccurate congestion feedback. There has been recent interest in protocols that obtain high-resolution estimates of congestion by combining the explicit congestion notification (ECN) marks of multiple packets, and using this to guide multiplicative increase, additive increase, multiplicative decrease (MI-AI-MD) window adaptation. This paper studies the potential of such approaches, both analytically and by simulation. The evaluation focuses on a new protocol called Binary Marking Congestion Control (BMCC). It is shown that these schemes can quickly acquire unused capacity, quickly approach a fair rate distribution, and have relatively smooth sending rates, even on high bandwidth-delay product networks. This is achieved while maintaining low average queue length and negligible packet loss. Using extensive simulations, we show that BMCC outperforms XCP, VCP, MLCP, CUBIC, CTCP, SACK, and in some cases RCP, in terms of average flow completion times. Suggestions are also given for the incremental deployment of BMCC.

388	An Integrated Flexible Implantable Micro-Probe for Sensing Neurotransmitters	Hung Cao; Ai-Ling Li; Nguyen, C.M.; Yuan-Bo Peng; Jung-Chih Chiao	Sensors Journal, IEEE	20120416	In this work, we have developed an integrated flexible implantable probe on a polyimide-film substrate for sensing neurotransmitters. The flexibility of the probe helps to prevent scar forming in tissues aiming for long-term in vivo monitoring. A micro Ag/AgCl reference electrode was integrated in the same probe with the Au/Cr or Pt/Cr working electrodes providing measurements without the need of a separate reference probe. Several electrode configurations have been considered and designed for implantation at various locations in the central nervous system. The prototype device for proof of principle was an enzyme-based electrochemical L-glutamate sensor using L-glutamate oxidase. A comparison between Au and Pt thin films was conducted by cyclic voltammetry to evaluate their performance as working electrodes. The L-glutamate oxidase was deposited on the working electrodes followed by a meta-Phenylenediamine electropolymerization process to improve the selectivity. The self-referencing technique was also utilized to enhance both the limit of detection and selectivity. The assembled sensors were calibrated and tested at various concentrations of L-glutamate with and without the presence of interfering molecules. The results showed good sensitivity and selectivity. In vivo animal tests were conducted to show the capability of detecting changes of electrochemical signals responding to graded peripheral somatosensory stimuli.

391	Recent Advances in AI for Computational Sustainability	Fisher, D.H.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20120824	This article intends, at a minimum, to give the briefest glimpse of the papers from the 2011 AAAI Computational Sustainability track, so that interested readers could follow up. Collectively, however, the contributions include representations of much that it might hope to see in an environmentally minded cognitive agent, with competencies in sensing and observation, knowledge-based reasoning, decision-making, and actuation. The creation of such agents could be an exciting and important ambition, with attention paid to agent communication as well. In the near term, however, AI will offer important, albeit specialized, cognitive tools for decision-makers. It is critical that these tools are adopted, adapted, and used by humans. Thus, it is vital that as part of our evaluation methodologies, it move beyond questions concerning technical optimality, and that it work with social, behavioral, and economic scientists to understand the social contexts in which our tools are used (or not)!	built environment.;natural environment;sustainability,Artificial intelligence;Computational modeling;Data models,cognitive systems;decision making;inference mechanisms;multi-agent systemsAI;agent communication;artificial intelligence;cognitive agent;cognitive tools;computational sustainability;decision-making;knowledge-based reasoning							
392	A Discrete Evolutionary Model for Chess Players' Ratings	Fenner, T.; Levene, M.; Loizou, G.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120612	The Elo system for rating chess players, also used in other games and sports, was adopted by the World Chess Federation over four decades ago. Although not without controversy, it is accepted as generally reliable and provides a method for assessing players' strengths and ranking them in official tournaments. It is generally accepted that the distribution of players' rating data is approximately normal but, to date, no stochastic model of how the distribution might have arisen has been proposed. We propose such an evolutionary stochastic model, which models the arrival of players into the rating pool, the games they play against each other, and how the results of these games affect their ratings, in a similar manner to the Elo system. Using a continuous approximation to the discrete model, we derive the distribution for players' ratings at time t as a normal distribution, where the variance increases in time as a logarithmic function of t. We validate the model using published rating data from 2007-2010, showing that the parameters obtained from the data can be recovered through simulations of the stochastic model. The distribution of players' ratings is only approximately normal and has been shown to have a small negative skew. We show how to modify our evolutionary stochastic model to take this skewness into account, and we validate the modified model using the published official rating data.

394	Energy-Efficient Video Multicast in 4G Wireless Systems	Ya-Ju Yu; Pi-Cheng Hsiu; Ai-Chun Pang	Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20120816	Layer-based video coding, together with adaptive modulation and coding, is a promising technique for providing real-time video multicast services on heterogeneous mobile devices. With the rapid growth of data communications for emerging applications, reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices is a major challenge. This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation for video multicast in fourth-generation wireless systems, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption for data reception. First, we consider the problem when scalable video coding is applied. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and propose a 2-approximation algorithm to solve it. Then, we investigate the problem under multiple description coding, and show that it is also NP-hard and cannot be approximated in polynomial time with a ratio better than 2, unless P = NP. To solve this case, we develop a pseudopolynomial time 2-approximation algorithm. The results of simulations conducted to compare the proposed algorithms with a brute-force optimal algorithm and a conventional approach are very encouraging.	4G wireless systems.;Energy efficiency;adaptive modulation and coding;multiple description coding;scalable video coding;video multicast,Approximation algorithms;Energy consumption;Modulation;Resource management;Static VAr compensators;Streaming media,4G mobile communication;adaptive codes;adaptive modulation;computational complexity;resource allocation;video coding2-approximation algorithm;4G wireless systems;NP-hard problem;adaptive coding;adaptive modulation;data communications;data reception;energy consumption;energy-efficient video multicast;fourth-generation wireless systems;heterogeneous mobile devices;layer-based video coding;multiple description coding;real-time video multicast services;resource allocation;scalable video coding							
395	Planning with Markov Decision Processes:An AI Perspective		Planning with Markov Decision Processes:An AI Perspective	20140702	Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are widely popular in Artificial Intelligence for modeling sequential decision-making scenarios with probabilistic dynamics. They are the framework of choice when designing an intelligent agent that needs to act for long periods of time in an environment where its actions could have uncertain outcomes. MDPs are actively researched in two related subareas of AI, probabilistic planning and reinforcement learning. Probabilistic planning assumes known models for the agent's goals and domain dynamics, and focuses on determining how the agent should behave to achieve its objectives. On the other hand, reinforcement learning additionally learns these models based on the feedback the agent gets from the environment. This book provides a concise introduction to the use of MDPs for solving probabilistic planning problems, with an emphasis on the algorithmic perspective. It covers the whole spectrum of the field, from the basics to state-of-the-art optimal and a proximation algorithms. We first describe the theoretical foundations of MDPs and the fundamental solution techniques for them. We then discuss modern optimal algorithms based on heuristic search and the use of structured representations. A major focus of the book is on the numerous approximation schemes for MDPs that have been developed in the AI literature. These include determinization-based approaches, sampling techniques, heuristic functions, dimensionality reduction, and hierarchical representations. Finally, we briefly introduce several extensions of the standard MDP classes that model and solve even more complex planning problems.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal that the SiO2 interlayer can effectively suppress Ge outdiffusion during HfO2 growth and subsequent postdeposition annealing process. The electrical measurement shows that capacitance equivalent thickness of 1.75 nm and a leakage current density of 3.9 � 10-3 A/cm2 at gate bias of flatband voltage (Vfb) + 1 V was obtained for the annealed sample. The conduction band offsets at the HfO2/SiO2/Ge with and without annealing are found to be 2.22 and 2.07 eV, respectively.

Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on	20120723	A biosensor based on a nanowire field-effect transistor is demonstrated on a bulk silicon wafer for low-cost applications. The silicon nanowire is fabricated using a simple reactive-ion etching technique known as the Bosch process. The sensor operation of the fabricated device is confirmed as a proof of concept by detecting the negatively and positively charged polymers on the nanowire surface in real time. The drain current of the device is clearly modulated by the charge polarity of the polymers. In addition, the specific binding of the antigen and the antibody for avian influenza is also detected by a real-time label-free electrical method for practical applications. Control experiments support that a charged species only on the nanowire surface leads to a significant change in the drain current of the sensor. The proposed approach in bulk nanowire biosensors paves the way for the application of complementary metalﾖoxideﾖsemiconductor technology for low-cost and miniaturized biosensors without external transducers; this approach is attractive in disposable and portable applications.

399	A Cluster and Gradient-Based Artificial Immune System Applied in Optimization Scenarios	de Mello Honorio, L.; Leite da Silva, A.M.; Barbosa, D.A.	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20120524	The main objective of this paper is to use artificial immune systems (AIS) in optimization problems. For this purpose, two major immunological principles presented in the literature are revisited: hypermutation, which is responsible for local search, and receptor edition, used to explore different areas in the solution space. This paper presents three major modifications divided into two different goals. The first goal is to speed up the convergence of each individual. This is done through a new hypermutation approach that uses the numerical information provided by the optimization system to drive the cloning process to interesting directions into the solution space. The second goal regards the reduction of the computational effort necessary to simulate the whole population. This is accomplished by adding to the AIS algorithm two more features of the natural immune system: maturation control and memory cells. The maturation control analyzes the antibodies and, during the convergence process, eliminates possible redundancies, represented by individuals driving to the same local optimum. The last proposed improvement is the use of memory cells in dynamic-optimization scenarios. In such situations, a repertoire of successful cases is used to forecast part of the initial population. Combining these concepts together decreases the number of antibodies, generations, and clones, consequently speeding up the convergence process. Applications illustrate the performance of the proposed method.

400	Unsupervised Modeling of Player Style With LDA	Gow, J.; Baumgarten, R.; Cairns, P.; Colton, S.; Miller, P.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120911	Computational analysis of player style has significant potential for video game design: it can provide insights into player behavior, as well as the means to dynamically adapt a game to each individual's style of play. To realize this potential, computational methods need to go beyond considerations of challenge and ability and account for aesthetic aspects of player style. We describe here a semiautomatic unsupervised learning approach to modeling player style using multiclass linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We argue that this approach is widely applicable for modeling player style in a wide range of games, including commercial applications, and illustrate it with two case studies: the first for a novel arcade game called Snakeotron, and the second for Rogue Trooper, a modern commercial third-person shooter video game.	$k$-means clustering;Adaptive games;linear discriminant analysis (LDA);log analysis;player style;player types;video games,Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Data models;Games;Linear discriminant analysis;Measurement;Principal component analysis,computer games;social aspects of automation;unsupervised learningLDA;Rogue Trooper;Snakeotron;aesthetic aspect;arcade game;computational analysis;modern commercial third-person shooter video game;multiclass linear discriminant analysis;player behavior;player style modeling;semiautomatic unsupervised learning;unsupervised modeling;video game design

402	Comparative Rate-Distortion-Complexity Analysis of HEVC and AVC Video Codecs	Vanne, J.; Viitanen, M.; Hamalainen, T.D.; Hallapuro, A.	Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20130107	This paper analyzes the rate-distortion-complexity of High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) reference video codec (HM) and compares the results with AVC reference codec (JM). The examined software codecs are HM 6.0 using Main Profile (MP) and JM 18.0 using High Profile (HiP). These codes are benchmarked under the all-intra (AI), random access (RA), low-delay B (LB), and low-delay P (LP) coding configurations. In order to obtain a fair comparison, JM HiP anchor codec has been configured to conform to HM MP settings and coding configurations. The rate-distortion comparisons rely on objective quality assessments, i.e., bit rate differences for equal PSNR. The complexities of HM and JM have been profiled at the cycle level with Intel VTune on Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The coding efficiency of HEVC is drastically better than that of AVC. According to our experiments, the average bit rate decrements of HM MP over JM HiP are 23%, 35%, 40%, and 35% under the AI, RA, LB, and LP configurations, respectively. However, HM achieves its coding gain with a realistic overhead in complexity. Our profiling results show that the average software complexity ratios of HM MP and JM HiP encoders are 3.2� in the AI case, 1.2� in the RA case, 1.5� in the LB case, and 1.3� in the LP case. The respective ratios with HM MP and JM HiP decoders are 2.0�, 1.6�, 1.5�, and 1.4�. This paper also reveals the bottlenecks of HM codec and provides implementation guidelines for future real-time HEVC codecs.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120911	This paper explores notions of elegance and shibui in combinatorial game design, and describes simple computational models for their estimation. Elegance is related to a game's simplicity, clarity, and efficiency, while shibui is a more complex concept from Japanese aesthetics that also incorporates depth. These provide new metrics for quantifying and categorizing games that are largely independent of existing measurements such as tractability and quality. Relevant ideas from Western and Eastern aesthetics are introduced, the meaning of elegance and shibui in combinatorial games is examined, and methods for estimating these values empirically are derived from complexity analyses. Elegance and shibui scores are calculated for a number of example games, for comparison. Preliminary results indicate shibui estimates to be more reliable than elegance estimates.

Antennas and Propagation, IEEE Transactions on	20120405	A parallelized real-valued clonal selection algorithm (CLONALG) is successfully implemented in this paper utilizing message passing interface (MPI) to reduce the computational burden of a large clone pool. CLONALG is one of the many branches of Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithms with unique inherent properties that make it a very efficient optimization techniques for multimodal problems such as the ones commonly encountered in computational electromagnetic design. As a demonstration of its effectiveness, a numerical study is carried out with known benchmark functions along with the optimization of multi-layered frequency selective surface (FSS) filters in the X-band. Our results show that the CLONALG can consistently outperform a standard GA implementation particularly in multi-modal optimization problems.

406	Monte Carlo Tree Search for the Hide-and-Seek Game Scotland Yard	Nijssen, P.; Winands, M.H.M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20121211	This paper describes how Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) can be applied to the hide-and-seek game Scotland Yard. This game is essentially a two-player game in which the players are moving on a graph-based map. First, we discuss how determinization is applied to handle the imperfect information in the game. We show how using determinization in a single tree performs better than using separate trees for each determinization. We also propose a new technique, called location categorization, that biases the possible locations of the hider. The experimental results reveal that location categorization is a robust technique, and significantly increases the performance of the seekers. Next, we describe how to handle the coalition of the seekers by using coalition reduction. This technique balances each seeker's participation in the coalition. Coalition reduction improves the performance of the seekers significantly. Furthermore, we explain how domain knowledge is incorporated by applying ?-greedy playouts and move filtering. Finally, we compare the MCTS players to minimax-based players, and we test the performance of our MCTS player against a commercial Scotland Yard program on the Nintendo DS. Based on the results, we may conclude that the MCTS-based hider and seekers play at a strong level.

409	References		The Machine Question:Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics	20121008	"One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the ""animal question""--consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the ""machine question"": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world."								
410	Analytical Model of Magnetic Force for Axial Stack Permanent-Magnet Bearings	Lu-Lin Tian; Xun-Peng Ai; Ya-Qi Tian	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20120920	Based on magnetic field of plane point magnetic charge, virtual work principle, and superposition theorem, the magnetic force analytical model for axial stack permanent-magnet bearings (PMB) is established. The aim is to solve the problem of the magnetic force analytical model's lack of being convenient in engineering design calculation of axial stack PMB. The relationship between magnetic force and structure parameters of PMB is analyzed. ANSYS simulation is adopted to test the validity of the magnetic force analytical model. The results indicate that the magnetic force of axial stack PMB is proportional to the magnetic annular average perimeter and the square of residual magnetism induction density, and that the magnetic force increases with an increment in the magnetic annular radial width and magnetic annular number. In the case of similar geometric parameters, the magnetic force of the same direction magnetization axial stack PMB is minimum: when the number of stack magnetic ring is 4, the maximum magnetic force of reversal magnetization axial stack PMB is approximately 4 times as much as the maximum magnetic force of equi-directional magnetization axial stack PMB; when the axial offset is only half of the axial length of single magnetic ring, the axial magnetic force is the maximum. Accordingly, the maximum magnetic force of rotational magnetization axial stack PMB is roughly 1.5 times as much as the maximum magnetic force of reversal magnetization axial stack PMB. When the axial deflection is equal to the axial length of single magnetic ring, the axial magnetic force is the maximum.

411	Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search	Cowling, P.I.; Powley, E.J.; Whitehouse, D.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120612	Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is an AI technique that has been successfully applied to many deterministic games of perfect information. This paper investigates the application of MCTS methods to games with hidden information and uncertainty. In particular, three new information set MCTS (ISMCTS) algorithms are presented which handle different sources of hidden information and uncertainty in games. Instead of searching minimax trees of game states, the ISMCTS algorithms search trees of information sets, more directly analyzing the true structure of the game. These algorithms are tested in three domains with different characteristics, and it is demonstrated that our new algorithms outperform existing approaches to handling hidden information and uncertainty in games.

412	A New Control Architecture for Robust Controllers in Rear Electric Traction Passenger HEVs	Sampaio, R.C.B.; Hernandes, A.C.; do Valle Magalha&#x0303;es Fernandes, V.; Becker, M.; Siqueira, A.A.G.	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20121012	It is well known that control systems are the core of electronic differential systems (EDSs) in electric vehicles (EVs)/hybrid HEVs (HEVs). However, conventional closed-loop control architectures do not completely match the needed ability to reject noises/disturbances, especially regarding the input acceleration signal incoming from the driver's commands, which makes the EDS (in this case) ineffective. Due to this, in this paper, a novel EDS control architecture is proposed to offer a new approach for the traction system that can be used with a great variety of controllers (e.g., classic, artificial intelligence (AI)-based, and modern/robust theory). In addition to this, a modified proportional-integral derivative (PID) controller, an AI-based neuro-fuzzy controller, and a robust optimal H? controller were designed and evaluated to observe and evaluate the versatility of the novel architecture. Kinematic and dynamic models of the vehicle are briefly introduced. Then, simulated and experimental results were presented and discussed. A Hybrid Electric Vehicle in Low Scale (HELVIS)-Sim simulation environment was employed to the preliminary analysis of the proposed EDS architecture. Later, the EDS itself was embedded in a dSpace 1103 high-performance interface board so that real-time control of the rear wheels of the HELVIS platform was successfully achieved.

The Schottky barrier devices faced to the difficulty on electrical discharging process due to the energy barrier forming at the interface, which can be resolved by using Ohmic devices. A memory window of 2.83 V at programming/erasing voltage of ﾱ13 V for Ohmic and 5.58 V at programming voltage of 13 V and light assisted erasing at -7 V for Schottky devices was obtained. Both memory devices using SiO2/SiOx/SiOxNy stacks showed a retention exceeding 70% of trapped charges 10 yr with operation voltages of ﾱ13 V at an only programming duration of 1 ms.

414	On the Construction of Cryptographically Significant Boolean Functions Using Objects in Projective Geometry Spaces	Pasalic, E.; Yongzhuang Wei	Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on	20120911	Recently, several construction methods of highly nonlinear Boolean functions with relatively good algebraic properties were proposed. These approaches manage in optimizing most of the relevant cryptographic criteria, but not all of them at the same time. Usually, either the nonlinearity bounds are rather loose (though the actual nonlinearity is relatively high) or the functions do not provide a good resistance to fast algebraic cryptanalysis. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for using objects in suitable projective geometry spaces for construction of highly nonlinear Boolean functions. This allows us to establish tight bounds on the nonlinearity using simple counting arguments, thus avoiding rather complicated estimates of certain trace sums. Our method generates a class of almost fully optimized functions, that is the functions apart from very high nonlinearity also have the maximum algebraic degree and optimal algebraic immunity. Compared to the classes of functions proposed by Carlet and Feng, Wang , and Zeng , our functions achieve a slightly better nonlinearity which is traded-off against a little worse resistance against fast algebraic attacks. On the other hand, compared to the functions by Tang and Tu and Deng, our nonlinearity is somewhat lower, but the algebraic properties are slightly better.

Its maximum repetitive rate is up to 10 Hz. The influence of repetitive rate and gas flow rate on the stability of output energy is studied and the main factor which influences the stability of output energy is analyzed. The experimental results show that increasing the gas flow rate into laser chamber can improve the stability of the output energy. The ideal output energy results of 20 laser pulses under different repetitive rates and their optimal experimental conditions are presented. Output energies of more than 4 J and better stability can be obtained when the laser device operates at 1, 2, and 5 Hz, respectively. When the gas feed rate is larger than 53 l/s, the stability of output energy is improved obviously at the repetitive rate of 10 Hz, and the average energy of 20 laser pulses is up to 3.2 J.	gas lasers;optical pumping;xenon compounds4255Lt;4260By,							
417	Evolving Multimodal Networks for Multitask Games	Schrum, J.; Miikkulainen, R.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120612	Intelligent opponent behavior makes video games interesting to human players. Evolutionary computation can discover such behavior, however, it is challenging to evolve behavior that consists of multiple separate tasks. This paper evaluates three ways of meeting this challenge via neuroevolution: 1) multinetwork learns separate controllers for each task, which are then combined manually; 2) multitask evolves separate output units for each task, but shares information within the network's hidden layer; and 3) mode mutation evolves new output modes, and includes a way to arbitrate between them. Whereas the fist two methods require that the task division be known, mode mutation does not. Results in Front/Back Ramming and Predator/Prey games show that each of these methods has different strengths. Multinetwork is good in both domains, taking advantage of the clear division between tasks. Multitask performs well in Front/Back Ramming, in which the relative difficulty of the tasks is even, but poorly in Predator/Prey, in which it is lopsided. Interestingly, mode mutation adapts to this asymmetry and performs well in Predator/Prey. This result demonstrates how a human-specified task division is not always the best. Altogether the results suggest how human knowledge and learning can be combined most effectively to evolve multimodal behavior.

419	N-Grams and the Last-Good-Reply Policy Applied in General Game Playing	Tak, M.J.W.; Winands, M.H.M.; Bjornsson, Y.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120612	The aim of general game playing (GGP) is to create programs capable of playing a wide range of different games at an expert level, given only the rules of the game. The most successful GGP programs currently employ simulation-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The performance of MCTS depends heavily on the simulation strategy used. In this paper, we introduce improved simulation strategies for GGP that we implement and test in the GGP agent CADIAPLAYER, which won the International GGP competition in both 2007 and 2008. There are two aspects to the improvements: first, we show that a simple ?-greedy exploration strategy works better in the simulation play-outs than the softmax-based Gibbs measure currently used in CADIAPLAYER and, second, we introduce a general framework based on N-grams for learning promising move sequences. Collectively, these enhancements result in a much improved performance of CADIAPLAYER. For example, in our test suite consisting of five different two-player turn-based games, they led to an impressive average win rate of approximately 70%. The enhancements are also shown to be effective in multiplayer and simultaneous-move games. We additionally perform experiments with the last-good-reply policy (LGRP). The LGRP combined with N-grams is also tested. The LGRP has already been shown to be successful in Go programs and we demonstrate that it also has promise in GGP.

422	A Novel Immune Clonal Algorithm for MO Problems	Ronghua Shang; Licheng Jiao; Fang Liu; Wenping Ma	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20120130	Research on multiobjective optimization (MO) becomes one of the hot points of intelligent computation. Compared with evolutionary algorithm, the artificial immune system used for solving MO problems (MOPs) has shown many good performances in improving the convergence speed and maintaining the diversity of the antibody population. However, the simple clonal selection computation has some difficulties in handling some more complex MOPs. In this paper, the simple clonal selection strategy is improved and a novel immune clonal algorithm (NICA) is proposed. The improvements in NICA are mainly focus on four aspects. 1) Antibodies in the antibody population are divided into dominated ones and nondominated ones, which is suitable for the characteristic of one multiobjective optimization problem has a series Pareto-optimal solutions. 2) The entire cloning is adopted instead of different antibodies having different clonal rate. 3) The clonal selection is based on the Pareto-dominance and one antibody is selected or not depending on whether it is a nondominated one, which is different from the traditional clonal selection manner. 4) The antibody population updating operation after the clonal selection is adopted, which makes antibody population under a certain size and guarantees the convergence of the algorithm. The influences of the main parameters are analyzed empirically. Compared with the existed algorithms, simulation results on MOPs and constrained MOPs show that NICA in most problems is able to And much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front.

First, a composite buffer layer structure, including GaN and AlGaN layer, was used to improve the crystal quality of the AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN DH. Second, interface roughness scattering was reduced by increasing the channel thickness, thus the two-dimensional electron gas mobility was further improved. Moreover, an ultrathin AlN interlayer was inserted between the GaN channel layer and the AlGaN buffer layer to decrease the alloy disorder scattering. The Hall effect measurements showed that the DH had better transport characteristics at high temperatures, and an electron mobility of 478 cm2/Vs was achieved at 573 K, which is twice larger than that of the conventional single heterostructure (?200 cm2/Vs at 573 K). Therefore, AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN DH is more suitable for the applications in high temperature electronic devices.

424	Distributed Computing by Oblivious Mobile Robots		Distributed Computing by Oblivious Mobile Robots	20140702	The study of what can be computed by a team of autonomous mobile robots, originally started in robotics and AI, has become increasingly popular in theoretical computer science (especially in distributed computing), where it is now an integral part of the investigations on computability by mobile entities. The robots are identical computational entities located and able to move in a spatial universe; they operate without explicit communication and are usually unable to remember the past; they are extremely simple, with limited resources, and individually quite weak. However, collectively the robots are capable of performing complex tasks, and form a system with desirable fault-tolerant and self-stabilizing properties. The research has been concerned with the computational aspects of such systems. In particular, the focus has been on the minimal capabilities that the robots should have in order to solve a problem. This book focuses on the recent algorithmic results in the field of distr buted computing by oblivious mobile robots (unable to remember the past). After introducing the computational model with its nuances, we focus on basic coordination problems: pattern formation, gathering, scattering, leader election, as well as on dynamic tasks such as flocking. For each of these problems, we provide a snapshot of the state of the art, reviewing the existing algorithmic results. In doing so, we outline solution techniques, and we analyze the impact of the different assumptions on the robots' computability power.

425	Neurovisual Control in the Quake II Environment	Parker, M.; Bryant, B.D.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120315	A wide variety of tasks may be performed by humans using only visual data as input. Creating artificial intelligence that adequately uses visual data allows controllers to use single cameras for input and to interact with computer games by merely reading the screen render. In this research, we use the Quake II game environment to compare various techniques that train neural network (NN) controllers to perform a variety of behaviors using only raw visual input. First, it is found that a humanlike retina, which has greater acuity in the center and less in the periphery, is more useful than a uniform acuity retina, both having the same number of inputs and interfaced to the same NN structure, when learning to attack a moving opponent in a visually simple room. Next, we use the same humanlike retina and NN in a more visually complex room, but, finding it is unable to learn successfully, we use a Lamarckian learning algorithm with a nonvisual hand-coded controller as a supervisor to help train the visual controller via backpropagation. Last, we replace the hand-coded supervising nonvisual controller with an evolved nonvisual NN controller, eliminating the human aspect from the supervision, and it solves a problem for which a solution was not previously known.

Sensors Journal, IEEE	20120416	Present work deals with the development of a low-cost prototype RH meter for measuring humidity in the range of 1-10% RH. The sensor working on capacitive technique consists of porous thin film of ?-AI2O3 formed between the parallel gold electrodes. The film was fabricated by dipcoating of sol solution obtained from the sol-gel method. The pore morphology of the sensor has been characterized by XRD, FESEM and BET analysis. The electrical parameters of the sensor have been determined by Agilent 4294A impedance analyzer. Response ( 10 s) and recovery ( 16 s) times of the sensor are better than the commercial sensor utilized for calibration (Xentaur, USA, LPDT-100). A suitable signal condition circuit has been developed to convert the capacitance change into voltage signal. For direct display of the humidity, the output of the sensor has been linearized by diode function generation. The prototype instrument has the potential for measuring humidity in different applications.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120315	Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithm's derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarize the results from the key game and nongame domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.

Depending on the dynamic settings of coupling ratios of the fiber couplers, the comb filter provides the channel spacing tunable, multiwavelength switchable, and flat-top spectral responses. Theoretical calculations are verified by the experimental results. Experimentally, a comb filter with the channel spacing tunable from 0.4 to 0.8 nm was obtained. Meanwhile, when the comb spacing was tuned to 0.8 nm, the multiwavelength switchable operation with both the sinusoid and flat-top spectral responses was achieved. The proposed comb filter may find applications in optical communication systems and tunable multiwavelength fiber lasers.

436	Area query processing based on gray code in wireless sensor networks	Ai, Chunyu; Duan, Yueming; Yan, Mingyuan; He, Jing	Tsinghua Science and Technology	20120928	Area query processing is significant for various applications of wireless sensor networks since it can request information of particular areas in the monitored environment. Existing query processing techniques cannot solve area queries. Intuitively centralized processing on Base Station can accomplish area queries via collecting information from all sensor nodes. However, this method is not suitable for wireless sensor networks with limited energy since a large amount of energy is wasted for reporting useless data. This motivates us to propose an energy-efficient in-network area query processing scheme. In our scheme, the monitored area is partitioned into grids, and a unique gray code number is used to represent a Grid ID (GID), which is also an effective way to describe an area. Furthermore, a reporting tree is constructed to process area merging and data aggregations. Based on the properties of GIDs, subareas can be merged easily and useless data can be discarded as early as possible to reduce energy consumption. For energy-efficiently answering continuous queries, we also design an incremental update method to continuously generate query results. In essence, all of these strategies are pivots to conserve energy consumption. With a thorough simulation study, it is shown that our scheme is effective and energy-efficient.	area query;area query processing;gray code;wireless sensor networks,Base stations;Monitoring;Query processing;Reflective binary codes;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks							
437	Assessment of Perturb and Observe MPPT Algorithm Implementation Techniques for PV Pumping Applications	Elgendy, M.A.; Zahawi, B.; Atkinson, D.J.	Sustainable Energy, IEEE Transactions on	20111215	The energy utilization efficiency of commercial photovoltaic (PV) pumping systems can be significantly improved by employing simple perturb and observe (P&O) maximum power point tracking algorithms. Two such P&O implementation techniques, reference voltage perturbation and direct duty ratio perturbation, are commonly utilized in the literature but no clear criteria for the suitable choice of method or algorithm parameters have been presented. This paper presents a detailed theoretical and experimental comparison of the two P&O implementation techniques on the basis of system stability, performance characteristics, and energy utilization for standalone PV pumping systems. The influence of algorithm parameters on system behavior is investigated and the various advantages and drawbacks of each technique are identified for different weather conditions. Practical results obtained using a 1080-Wp PV array connected to a 1-kW permanent magnet dc motor-centrifugal pump set show very good agreement with the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.

Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine, IEEE	20121203	This paper has described a laboratory-scale DFIG test facility commissioned to investigate the low voltage fault behavior of a DFIG wind turbine generator. In this DFIG test facility, a dc motor driven by a four-quadrant dc drive is used as a prime mover to replicate the torque input from a wind turbine's drive shaft. A mechanical model created in Simulink is executed by the dSpace controller. The IGBT power converter and dc-link capacitors are over-rated to withstand various grid faults. The fault emulator permits a flexible approach to the application of grid faults and also provides an opportunity to mimic the typical grid connection impedance of a wind turbine.	,Atmospheric measurements;Circuit faults;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Rotors;Stators;Voltage measurement;Wind turbines,DC motor drives;asynchronous generators;capacitors;electric impedance;insulated gate bipolar transistors;power convertors;power generation faults;power grids;power system interconnection;shafts;torque;wind power plants;wind turbinesDC link capacitor;DC motor drive;DFIG test facility;IGBT power converter;Simulink;dSpace controller;doubly fed induction generator;drive shaft;fault emulator;grid connection impedance;grid fault ride through analysis;mechanical model;prime mover;torque;wind turbine generator							
439	Structure stabilities and transitions in polyhedral metal nanocrystals: An atomic-bond-relaxation approach	Zhang, Ai; Zhu, Ziming; He, Yan; Ouyang, Gang	Applied Physics Letters	20120430	We present an atomic-bond-relaxation (ABR) method to illustrate a deeper insight on structure stabilities and transitions of metal nanocrystals with polyhedral structure based on the thermodynamic consideration. It has been found that the end effects in polyhedral nanocrystals induced by the atoms located at edges, side facets, and vertexes play the dominant roles for their structure performances. The theoretical predictions are well consistent with the experimental measurements and simulations, which suggest the ABR model can be an effective method to understand solid-solid phase transition of polyhedral metal nanocrystals.	bonds (chemical);nanostructured materials;solid-state phase transformations;thermodynamic properties6146Df;6470Nd;8260Qr,

The Ostwald ripening process was believed to be the main driving force for the formation of hollow urchin-like architectures. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of hollow urchin-like ?-FeOOH were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The CV results implied that the capacitance was mainly associated with the redox mechanism. The specific capacitance value was 88.5 F/g calculated from the discharge curve at the current density of 0.5 A.g. The hollow urchin-like ?-FeOOH shows a good electrochemical performance.

441	John McCarthy [History]	Sabanovic, S.; Milojevic, S.; Kaur, J.	Robotics & Automation Magazine, IEEE	20121210	John McCarthy is best known as one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence (AI), a term he coined in 1955, and much has been written about his pioneering work in computer and cognitive science (Figure 1). Less attention has been given to McCarthy's efforts related to robotics, though his AI research instigated and influenced development in the field. As the founder of the Stanford-AI Lab (SAIL) and its director from 1965 to 1980, McCarthy participated in research on computer vision, speech recognition, and planning in robotics, collaborated with innovators such as Bernie Roth and Vic Scheinman to develop some of the first robot arms, and advised 30 students, a number of whom have gone on to become leaders in robotics and AI.	,Artificial intelligence;Biographies;History							
442	Bitwise-Parallel Reduction for Connection Tests	Browne, C.; Tavener, S.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120612	This paper introduces bitwise-parallel reduction (BPR), an efficient method for performing connection tests in hexagonal connection games such as Hex and Y. BPR is based on a known property of Y that games can be reduced to a single value indicating the fully connected player (if any) through a sequence of reduction operations. We adapt this process for bitwise-parallel implementation and demonstrate its benefit over a range of board sizes. BPR is by far the fastest known method if connection tests only need to be performed once per game, for example, to evaluate board fills following Monte Carlo playouts.

443	Benchmarks for Grid-Based Pathfinding	Sturtevant, N.R.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120612	The study of algorithms on grids has been widespread in a number of research areas. Grids are easy to implement and offer fast memory access. Because of their simplicity, they are used even in commercial video games. But, the evaluation of work on grids has been inconsistent between different papers. Many research papers use different problem sets, making it difficult to compare results between papers. Furthermore, the performance characteristics of each test set are not necessarily obvious. This has motivated the creation of a standard test set of maps and problems on the maps that are open for all researchers to use. In addition to creating these sets, we use a variety of metrics to analyze the properties of the test sets. The goal is that these test sets will be useful to many researchers, making experimental results more comparable across papers, and improving the quality of research on grid-based domains.

444	Transient Earth Voltage Measurement in PD Detection of Artificial Defect Models in   	Ming Ren; Ming Dong; Zhong Ren; Hua-Dong Peng; Ai-Ci Qiu	Plasma Science, IEEE Transactions on	20120807	This paper mainly discussed the utilization of transient Earth voltage measurement (TEVM) in partial discharge (PD) detection of gas insulation switchgear. Four typical artificial defect models in SF6 such as spikes fixed on high voltage (HV) conductor, suspended metals, voids in dielectric, and metal particles on the surface of dielectric had been used as test objects in ac PD experiments with the aid of the synchronized PD signals sampled from a transient Earth voltage sensor, photomultiplier, Rogowski monitor, and PDCheck system. The measuring results of TEVM results, which included the phase distribution of PD, the relative amplitude, and the pulse number of different voltage thresholds, showed good consistency with three other methods and had better sensitivity of detection in spark or corona PD patterns. For further study, the frequency distributions of the three PD patterns were analyzed and discussed for understanding the different measurement sensitivities showed in different typical defects in SF6 . In addition, TEVM was applied to detect PD under oscillating impulse voltage. As an example, the needle-plane electrode with short gap was adopted under 613.2-kHz oscillating impulse, which showed the effectiveness in this kind of detection.

445	Integrated Traffic and Communication Performance Evaluation of an Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) System for Online Travel-Time Prediction	Yongchang Ma; Chowdhury, M.; Sadek, A.; Jeihani, M.	Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20120828	This paper presents a framework for online highway travel-time prediction using traffic measurements that are likely to be available from vehicle infrastructure integration (VII) systems, in which vehicle and infrastructure devices communicate to improve mobility and safety. In the proposed intelligent VII system, two artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR), are used to determine future travel time based on such information as the current travel time and VII-enabled vehicles' flow and density. The development and performance evaluation of the VII-ANN and VII-SVR frameworks, in both the traffic and communications domains, were conducted using an integrated simulation platform for a highway network in Greenville, SC. In particular, the simulation platform allows for implementing traffic surveillance and management methods in the traffic simulator PARAMICS and for evaluating different communication protocols and network parameters in the communication network simulator, Network Simulator version 2 (ns-2). This paper's findings reveal that the designed communications system can support the travel-time prediction functionality. The findings also demonstrate that the travel-time prediction accuracy of the VII-AI framework was superior to a baseline instantaneous travel-time prediction algorithm, with the VII-SVR model slightly outperforming the VII-ANN model. Moreover, the VII-AI framework was shown to perform reasonably well during nonrecurrent congestion scenarios, which have traditionally challenged sensor-based highway travel-time prediction methods.

447	Propagation mechanism modelling in the near region of circular tunnels	Guan, K.; Zhong, Z.; Ai, B.; Briso-Rodr&#x0131;&#x0131;guez, C.	Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation, IET	20120416	Along with the increase in operating frequencies in advanced radio communication systems utilised inside tunnels, the location of the break point is further and further away from the transmitter. This means that the near region lengthens considerably and even occupies the whole propagation cell or the entire length of some short tunnels. To begin with, this study analyses the propagation loss resulting from the free-space mechanism and the multi-mode waveguide mechanism in the near region of circular tunnels, respectively. Then, by conjunctive employing the propagation theory and the three-dimensional solid geometry, a general analytical model of the dividing point between two propagation mechanisms is presented for the first time. Moreover, the model is validated by a wide range of measurement campaigns in different tunnels at different frequencies. Finally, discussions on the simplified formulae of the dividing point in some application situations are made. The results in this study can be helpful to grasp the essence of the propagation mechanism inside tunnels.	radio transmitters;radiocommunication;radiowave propagation;tunnels;waveguidesadvanced radio communication system;circular tunnel;free-space mechanism;general analytical model;multimode waveguide mechanism;propagation loss analysis;propagation mechanism modelling;three-dimensional solid geometry;transmitter

451	Evaluating the Aesthetics of Endgame Studies: A Computational Model of Human Aesthetic Perception	Iqbal, A.; van der Heijden, H.; Guid, M.; Makhmali, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120911	In this paper, we explain how an existing computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems was improved and adapted to suit the domain of chess endgame studies. Studies are typically longer and more ﾓsophisticatedﾔ in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges. To some extent, it may also contribute to our understanding of the psychology of human aesthetic perception and the ﾓmechanicsﾔ of human creativity in composing problems and studies.

454	Beyond Skill Rating: Advanced Matchmaking in Ghost Recon Online	Delalleau, O.; Contal, E.; Thibodeau-Laufer, E.; Ferrari, R.C.; Bengio, Y.; Zhang, F.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20120911	Player satisfaction is particularly difficult to ensure in online games, due to interactions with other players. In adversarial multiplayer games, matchmaking typically consists in trying to match together players of similar skill level. However, this is usually based on a single-skill value, and assumes the only factor of ﾓfunﾔ is the game balance. We present a more advanced matchmaking strategy developed for Ghost Recon Online, an upcoming team-focused first-person shooter (FPS) from Ubisoft (Montreal, QC, Canada). We first show how incorporating more information about players than their raw skill can lead to more balanced matches. We also argue that balance is not the only factor that matters, and present a strategy to explicitly maximize the players' fun, taking advantage of a rich player profile that includes information about player behavior and personal preferences. Ultimately, our goal is to ask players to provide direct feedback on match quality through an in-game survey. However, because such data were not available for this study, we rely here on heuristics tailored to this specific game. Experiments on data collected during Ghost Recon Online's beta tests show that neural networks can effectively be used to predict both balance and player enjoyment.

455	Enhanced Arctic Sea Ice Drift Estimation Merging Radiometer and Scatterometer Data	Fanny Girard-Ardhuin; Ezraty, R.	Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20120620	Satellites enable daily and global coverage of the polar oceans and provide a unique monitoring capability of sea ice dynamics. Sea ice drift maps can be estimated in Arctic from several satellite sensors, particularly from scatterometers and radiometers. This study presents the benefits of combining single drift fields at the same resolution into a �merged� field, built at three- and six-day lags during winters with a 62.5-km resolution. It is shown that combining these drift fields not only increases the reliability of the displacement estimation and the number of estimated vectors to almost a full ice covered area but also expands the time period over which these estimations are reliable from freeze until the melt onset. The autumn-winter-spring sea ice drift fields presented here are systematically produced at Institut Fran�ais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer/Centre d'Exploitation et de Recherche Satellitaire, the sea ice drift 1992-2011 time series is available, and the processing is ongoing.

456	An Efficient Probabilistic Assessment Method for Electricity Market Risk Management	Jie Huang; Yusheng Xue; Zhao Yang Dong; Kit Po Wong	Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20120718	Managing electricity market risks is crucial for market participants. For electricity price risk management, expectation and standard deviation of price, along with possible occurrence of price spike, need to be assessed in order to support further risk control. In this paper, a hybrid probabilistic assessment method based on adaptive importance sampling (AIS) and sequential importance sampling (SIS) is developed. Improvements on AIS and SIS make the method better suit electricity market problems. Case studies are conducted on an equivalent Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) system. Uncertainties considered include system load, renewable energy output, generator bidding strategy, and outage rate. The proposed method provides much faster estimation of both normal price and price spike probability, meanwhile achieving comparable accuracy as Monte Carlo (MC) simulation results. Sensitivity of its estimation efficiency against different load level is also analyzed, which shows the robustness of the proposed method.

457	A Cross-Layer Scheme for Solving Hidden Device Problem in IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Sensor Networks	Hsueh-Wen Tseng; Shan-Chi Yang; Ping-Cheng Yeh; Ai-Chun Pang	Sensors Journal, IEEE	20101122	The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is designed to achieve low-power transmissions in low-rate and short-distance wireless personal area networks (WPANs). For the sake of reducing the control overheads, the modified CSMA/CA protocol used by 802.15.4 does not have the hidden device protection mechanism, such as RTS/CTS mechanism. Previous studies indicated that the probability of any two devices in an infrastructure network unheard of each other is around 41%. Therefore, the hidden device problem (HDP) results in inefficient data transmission and serious power consumption issues in WPAN. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer detection and allocation (CL-DNA) scheme to solve the HDP in IEEE 802.15.4 without the cost of extra control overhead in data transmissions. The proposed scheme detects relationships of hidden devices based on the overlapped signals and then allocates the hidden devices into distinct subperiods for transmissions. Simulation results validated by mathematical analysis show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the goodput with the reduction in power consumption.

In this letter, a low-profile wideband VHF/UHF antenna based on the conventional discone antenna is proposed. It is composed of a discone antenna that is flattened with additions of a cavity-backed discone, a short-circuited configuration, and a two-plate top structure. The simulation results show that the addition of the three structures makes the proposed antenna low-profile and wideband. A prototype with optimized geometrical parameters was fabricated and tested. The measurements show that the prototype has a VSWR bandwidth of 76% from 200 to 447 MHz, a height of only 0.087?max, and a radiation pattern of omnidirectivity.

459	Effect of Cavity-Triggering Sequences on Output Parameters of LTD-Based Drivers	Peng Liu; Fengju Sun; Jiahui Yin; Tianxue Liang; Xiaofeng Jiang; Zhigang Liu; Aici Qiu	Plasma Science, IEEE Transactions on	20110510	This paper explores the feasibility of improving the load current parameters by optimizing the cavity-triggering sequences for a linear transformer driver (LTD) module with 60 cavities connected in series. The mechanism behind this was analyzed. The results demonstrate that it is necessary for the improvement in the output parameters of the LTD to postpone the closure of the switches in the cavities later than the arrival of the electromagnetic pulse propagating downstream. However, this requires the switches to withstand pulsed voltages higher than their charge voltage before closing. When the LTD switches withstood a pulsed voltage peak of about 400 kV for several tens of nanoseconds before closing, the LTD module could generate a current pulse with a rise time of 12.5 ns and a peak of 1340 kA on the matched load.

460	Partially Precomputed A  	Hewlett, W.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110613	A* is a commonly used technique for finding shortest paths for navigation in video games. We propose partially precomputed A* (PPA*), which is much faster than A* at runtime, and uses much less memory than completely precalculating all shortest paths with an algorithm such as Floyd-Warshall. At runtime, PPA* is very similar to A*, so it is simple and safe to integrate into existing video game code bases.

The results of I-V data, AFM and SEM images indicated that the WORM memory characteristics of GO diodes were mainly attributed to charge trapping at GO layers and interfacial properties between GO and LiF/Al electrode.	aluminium;diodes;electrical conductivity transitions;fullerene devices;graphene;indium compounds;lithium compounds;thin film devices;thin films;write-once storage8430Sk,

By properly rotating the polarization controllers (PCs), up to 7-wavelength mode-locked pulses in 3-dB bandwidth with 3.65-nm channel spacing are obtained. The wavelength switchable operation is determined by the characteristics of the comb filter used in the experiment. Taking advantage of an intensity-dependent loss mechanism caused by the nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) effect, the mode competition is efficiently suppressed. In addition, the lasing locations of multiwavelength mode-locked pulses can be flexibly tuned via the wavelength-dependent loss mechanism.

Using this expression, a method of laser linewidth characterization and in-service monitoring is proposed in presence of additive white noise applicable to both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems. The method is further substantiated by experiments of 107-Gb/s coherent optical OFDM transmission over 960-km SSMF fiber.

466	Online estimation of system parameters for artificial intelligence applications to load frequency control	Chang-Chien, L.-R.; Wu, Y.-S.; Cheng, J.-S.	Generation, Transmission & Distribution, IET	20110801	Making balance between generation and demand is the operating principle of the load frequency control. As the automatic generation control (AGC) has been commissioned to serve load-generation balance for several decades, the developmental roadmap of the AGC is leading to the adaptive or artificial intelligence (AI) applications to the controller design. Among the AI applications, the genetic algorithm (GA) and the fuzzy inference system (FIS) are often adopted to optimise AGC gains under the time-varying system conditions. Relevant studies indicate that the real-time acquisition of system states would be advantageous for AGC to drive system to the optimal condition. However, some of the system parameters are not easily accessible. The object of getting good estimate of system parameters in real-time basis would definitely enhance the performance of the intelligence applications to AGC. This study explores the use of recursive least square algorithm for acquiring the system parameters in real time. As such, a more accurate reference model would be gainfully used in the AI controller design. Issues related to the model validation in the simulation and field test are presented. Following that, the use of the reference model in the GA as well as the FIS applications for the optimal gain scheduling of the AGC is demonstrated.	artificial intelligence;control engineering computing;control system synthesis;frequency control;fuzzy reasoning;genetic algorithms;least squares approximations;load regulation;power engineering computing;power generation control;recursive estimationAGC;AI controller design;FIS;FIS application;GA;artificial intelligence applications;automatic generation control;fuzzy inference system application;genetic algorithm;load frequency control;load online estimation;load-generation balance;optimal gain scheduling;parameter estimation;real-time acquisition;recursive least square algorithm;system parameters

It is found that the bandgap energies of NPs structures are unambiguously blueshifted as compared with those of nanowires with the same sizes and the bulk counterparts. The anomalous surface energies in the inner and outer surfaces of NPs structures seem the physical origin of the bandgap shifts. Agreement between the theoretical predictions and the evidence from experimental measurements and calculations suggested that the proposed method could be expected to be applicable to NPs structural materials.	elemental semiconductors;energy gap;nanoporous materials;porous semiconductors;silicon;spectral line shift;surface energy6835Md;7123Cq;7322-f;8105Cy;8105Rm;8107Bc,							
468	A Short Introduction to Preferences: Between AI and Social Choice		A Short Introduction to Preferences: Between AI and Social Choice	20140702	Computational social choice is an expanding field that merges classical topics like economics and voting theory with more modern topics like artificial intelligence, multiagent systems, and computational complexity. This book provides a concise introduction to the main research lines in this field, covering aspects such as preference modelling, uncertainty reasoning, social choice, stable matching, and computational aspects of preference aggregation and manipulation. The book is centered around the notion of preference reasoning, both in the single-agent and the multi-agent setting. It presents the main approaches to modeling and reasoning with preferences, with particular attention to two popular and powerful formalisms, soft constraints and CP-nets.

470	A Tuneable Active Inductor With High Dynamic Range for Band-Pass Filter Applications	Leuzzi, G.; Stornelli, V.; Del Re, S.	Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, IEEE Transactions on	20111017	An approach for the design of high-Q active inductor (AI) with high dynamic range is presented. The proposed AI includes a passive variable phase- and amplitude-compensating network and a highly linear inverting amplifier, forming a gyrator-C architecture. The equivalent inductance and resistance values are tunable in a wide frequency range; outside the operating frequency band, the inductor equivalent resistance increases, improving signal rejection for band-pass filter applications. As a feasibility demonstration, a first-order active band-pass filter using the high-Q active inductance has been fabricated and tested. The filter has a center frequency of 600 MHz and a measured noise figure of 11 dB with a 5-dBm 1-dB compression point and an 82-dB dynamic range.

473	Edge effect on band gap shift in Si nanowires with polygonal cross-sections	Zhu, Ziming; Zhang, Ai; Ouyang, Gang; Yang, Guowei	Applied Physics Letters	20110707	The strain-dependent band gap shift of Si nanowires (SiNWs) induced by the edge effect has been investigated by taking into account the shell-core configurations. It was found that the geometry of SiNWs plays the dominant effect for their band structures due to the appearance of strain in the self-equilibrium state. Theoretical analyses demonstrated that the derived relation is applicable for the band gap shift of SiNWs with polygonal cross-sections. The results were validated by compared them with the available evidences, implying that the developed method is helpful for clarifying physical mechanisms on tunable optical-electronics properties of semiconductor nanostructures.	elemental semiconductors;energy gap;nanowires;silicon6146Km;7120Mq;7322-f;8105Cy;8107Gf,							
474	Interference Elimination for Chinese DTMB System With Transmit Diversity	Wenting Chang; Jintao Wang; Bo Ai; Yangang Li; Jian Song	Broadcasting, IEEE Transactions on	20110822	When adopting transmit diversity in the Chinese digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB) system, there exists two kinds of interference: training sequences (TSs) from different transmit antennas are overlapped; and the TSs are interfered with OFDM data due to multipath fading. In order to distinguish different TSs, this paper proposes a method to design orthogonal TS set, which also have good correlation characteristic. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm to eliminate the interference between TSs and data is proposed and theoretically analyzed. Finally, simulations are performed and the results show that the system with the proposed scheme can achieve great diversity gain under acceptable computational complexity.

476	Transaction Management in Service-Oriented Systems: Requirements and a Proposal	Chang-ai Sun; El Khoury, E.; Aiello, M.	Services Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20110527	Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is becoming the mainstream development paradigm of applications over the Internet, taking advantage of remote independent functionalities. The cornerstone of SOC's success lies in the potential advantage of composing services on the fly. When the control over the communication and the elements of the information system is low, developing solid systems is challenging. In particular, developing reliable web service compositions usually requires the integration of both composition languages, such as the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), and of coordination protocols, such as WS-AtomicTransaction and WS-BusinessActivity. Unfortunately, the composition and coordination of web services currently have separate languages and specifications. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we identify the major requirements of transaction management in Service-oriented systems and survey the relevant standards. Second, we propose a semiautomatic approach to integrate BPEL specifications and web service coordination protocols, that is, implementing transaction management within service composition processes, and thus overcoming the limitations of current technologies.

Along the curvature change, the wettability of this flexible film was changed from isotropic state (150ﾰ/150ﾰ) into anisotropic state confirmed by its anisotropic contact angles (150ﾰ/160ﾰ) and sliding properties (30ﾰ/65ﾰ). Further investigation revealed that the surface wettability was changed from composited pinned state into transitional state. This was attributed to the increase in roughness factor and the decrease in the contact area between the water droplet and the pillar array. At last, we demonstrate that the wetting states between isotropy and anisotropy on this flexible superhydrophobic film could be reversibly switched by curvature for many times (>10).	arrays;contact angle;curvature measurement;drops;hydrophilicity;hydrophobicity;polymer films;surface roughness;wetting6803Cd;6808Bc;6835bm;6855am,

479	Multiple Player Tracking in Sports Video: A Dual-Mode Two-Way Bayesian Inference Approach With Progressive Observation Modeling	Junliang Xing; Haizhou Ai; Liwei Liu; Shihong Lao	Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on	20110516	Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a very challenging task yet of fundamental importance for many practical applications. In this paper, we focus on the problem of tracking multiple players in sports video which is even more difficult due to the abrupt movements of players and their complex interactions. To handle the difficulties in this problem, we present a new MOT algorithm which contributes both in the observation modeling level and in the tracking strategy level. For the observation modeling, we develop a progressive observation modeling process that is able to provide strong tracking observations and greatly facilitate the tracking task. For the tracking strategy, we propose a dual-mode two-way Bayesian inference approach which dynamically switches between an offline general model and an online dedicated model to deal with single isolated object tracking and multiple occluded object tracking integrally by forward filtering and backward smoothing. Extensive experiments on different kinds of sports videos, including football, basketball, as well as hockey, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110912	This paper investigates strategies to generate levels for action-adventure games. For this genre, level design is more critical than for rule-driven genres such as simulation or rogue-like role-playing games, for which procedural level generation has been successful in the past. The approach outlined by this article distinguishes between missions and spaces as two separate structures that need to be generated in two individual steps. It discusses the merits of different types of generative grammars for each individual step in the process. Notably, the approach acknowledges that the online generation of levels needs to be tailored strictly to the actual experience of a player. Therefore, the approach incorporates techniques to establish and exploit player models in actual play.

491	Timing Acquisition for Bandlimited Long-Code DS-CDMA in Doubly-Selective Fading Channels	Shuai Wang; Ai-hua Wang; Jian-ping An; Hanzo, L.	Signal Processing Letters, IEEE	20111006	The code timing acquisition problem of bandlimited long-code based DS-CDMA systems operating in doubly-selective time-varying multipath channels is considered. We extend the unstructured schemes proposed by Buzzi to long-code spreading, which first estimates the Symbol Weighted Composite Channel Impulse Response (SW-CCIR) vectors and then extracts the timing informations. We also propose novel structured acquisition schemes, which directly estimate the multipath propagation delays by exploiting the a priori knowledge of the chip waveform. Both the structured and unstructured schemes are blind, since they require no other a priori information but the aperiodic spreading code of the desired user.

493	Generating Consistent Buildings: A Semantic Approach for Integrating Procedural Techniques	Tutenel, T.; Smelik, R.M.; Lopes, R.; de Kraker, K.J.; Bidarra, R.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110912	Computer games often take place in extensive virtual worlds, attractive for roaming and exploring. Unfortunately, current virtual cities can strongly hinder this kind of gameplay, since the buildings they feature typically have replicated interiors, or no interiors at all. Procedural content generation is becoming more established, with many techniques for automatically creating specific building elements. However, the integration of these techniques to form complete buildings is still largely unexplored, limiting their application to open game worlds. We propose a novel approach that integrates existing procedural techniques to generate such buildings. With minimal extensions, individual techniques can be coordinated to create buildings with consistently interrelated exteriors and interiors, as in the real world. Our solution offers a framework where various procedural techniques communicate with a moderator, which is responsible for negotiating the placement of building elements, making use of a library of semantic classes and constraints. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by presenting several examples featuring the integration of a fa�ade shape grammar, two different floor plan layout generation techniques, and furniture placement techniques. We conclude that this approach allows one to preserve the individual qualities of existing procedural techniques, while assisting the consistency maintenance of the generated buildings.

Circuits, Devices & Systems, IET	20110120	This study presents a novel rail-to-rail second generation current conveyor (CCII) based on quasi-floating gate transistors. The circuit operates at very low supply voltage (ﾱ0.5ﾱV), dissipates ultra-low standby power (27ﾱﾱW), has very high bandwidth (f-3-dB of 191 and 181 MHz for Ai and Av, respectively) and low input resistance (1.5 ). Most favourably, its total harmonic distortion is 69 dB at an input voltage of 99 of power supply and frequency of 100 KHz. HSPICE simulation results confirm the feasibility and the robustness of the presented CCII against process variations (worst-case parameters) and temperature variation. Performance of this CCII is verified using a low-power grounded-capacitor single resistance-controlled oscillator.

496	The MP-MIX Algorithm: Dynamic Search Strategy Selection in Multiplayer Adversarial Search	Zuckerman, I.; Felner, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20111212	When constructing a search tree for multiplayer games, there are two basic approaches to propagating the opponents' moves. The first approach, which stems from the MaxN algorithm, assumes each opponent will follow his highest valued heuristic move. In the second approach, the paranoid algorithm, the player prepares for the worst case by assuming the opponents will select the worst move with respect to him. There is no definite answer as to which approach is better, and their main shortcoming is that their strategy is fixed. We therefore suggest the MaxN-paranoid mixture (MP-Mix) algorithm: a multiplayer adversarial search that switches search strategies according to the game situation. The MP-mix algorithm examines the current situation and decides whether the root player should follow the MaxN principle, the paranoid principle, or the newly presented directed offensive principle. To evaluate our new algorithm, we performed extensive experimental evaluation on three multiplayer domains: Hearts, Risk, and Quoridor. In addition, we also introduce the opponent impact (OI) measure, which measures the players' ability to impede their opponents' efforts, and show its relation to the relative performance of the MP-mix strategy. The results show that our MP-mix strategy significantly outperforms MaxN and paranoid in various settings in all three games.

497	Classification of Buried Targets Using Ground Penetrating Radar: Comparison Between Genetic Programming and Neural Networks	Kobashigawa, J.S.; Hyoung-sun Youn; Iskander, M.F.; Zhengqing Yun	Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters, IEEE	20111003	The detection and classification of buried targets such as unexploded ordnance (UXO) using ground penetrating radar (GPR) technology involves complex qualitative features and 2-D scattering images. These processes are often performed by human operators and are thus subject to error and bias. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as neural networks (NN) and fuzzy systems, have been applied to develop autonomous classification algorithms and have shown promising results. Genetic programming (GP), a relatively new AI method, has also been examined for these classification purposes. In this letter, the results of a comparison between the classification performances of NN versus the GP techniques for GPR UXO data are presented. Simulated 2-D scattering patterns from one UXO target and four non-UXO objects are used in this comparison. Different levels of noise and cases of untrained data are also examined. Obtained results show that GP provides better performance than NN methods with increasing problem difficulty. Genetic programming also showed robustness to untrained data as well as an inherent capability of providing global optimal searching, which could minimize efforts on training processes.

498	Incorporation of a Left Ventricle Finite Element Model Defining Infarction Into the XCAT Imaging Phantom	Veress, A.I.; Segars, W.P.; Tsui, B.M.W.; Gullberg, G.T.	Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on	20110405	The 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom was developed to provide a realistic and flexible model of the human anatomy and cardiac and respiratory motions for use in medical imaging research. A prior limitation to the phantom was that it did not accurately simulate altered functions of the heart that result from cardiac pathologies such as coronary artery disease (CAD). We overcame this limitation in a previous study by combining the phantom with a finite-element (FE) mechanical model of the left ventricle (LV) capable of more realistically simulating regional defects caused by ischemia. In the present work, we extend this model giving it the ability to accurately simulate motion abnormalities caused by myocardial infarction (MI), a far more complex situation in terms of altered mechanics compared with the modeling of acute ischemia. The FE model geometry is based on high resolution CT images of a normal male subject. An anterior region was defined as infarcted and the material properties and fiber distribution were altered, according to the bio-physiological properties of two types of infarction, i.e., fibrous and remodeled infarction (30% thinner wall than fibrous case). Compared with the original, surface-based 4D beating heart model of the XCAT, where regional abnormalities are modeled by simply scaling down the motion in those regions, the FE model was found to provide a more accurate representation of the abnormal motion of the LV due to the effects of fibrous infarction as well as depicting the motion of remodeled infarction. In particular, the FE models allow for the accurate depiction of dyskinetic motion. The average circumferential strain results were found to be consistent with measured dyskinetic experimental results. Combined with the 4D XCAT phantom, the FE model can be used to produce realistic multimodality sets of imaging data from a variety of patients in which the normal or abnormal cardiac function is accurately represented.

The superiority of zigzag graphene in thermal conductivity is only available in high temperature region and disappears in multilayer case.

Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20110411	Online fault diagnosis plays a crucial role in providing the required fault tolerance to drive systems used in safety-critical applications. Short-circuit faults are among the common faults occurring in electrical machines. This paper presents a review of existing techniques available for online stator interturn fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in electrical machines. Special attention is given to short-circuit-fault diagnosis in permanent-magnet machines, which are fast replacing traditional machines in a wide variety of applications. Recent techniques that use signals analysis, models, or knowledge-based systems for FDD are reviewed in this paper. Motor current is the most commonly analyzed signal for fault diagnosis. Hence, motor current signature analysis is a topic of elaborate discussion in this paper. Additionally, parametric and finite-element models that were designed to simulate interturn-fault conditions are reviewed.

503	Two-Stage Monte Carlo Tree Search for Connect6	Shi-Jim Yen; Jung-Kuei Yang	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110613	Recently, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has become a well-known game search method, and has been successfully applied to many games. This method performs well in solving search trees with numerous branches, such as Go, Havannah, etc. Connect6 is a game involving a search tree with numerous branches, and it is also one of the sudden-death games. This paper thus proposes a new MCTS variant related to Connect6, called two-stage MCTS. The first stage focuses on threat space search (TSS), which is designed to solve the sudden-death problem. For the double-threat TSS in Connect6, this study proposes an algorithm called iterative threat space search (ITSS) which combines normal TSS with conservative threat space search (CTSS). The second stage uses MCTS to estimate the game-theoretic value of the initial position. This stage aims at finding the most promising move. The experimental result shows that two-stage MCTS is considerably more efficient than traditional MCTS on those positions with TSS solution in Connect6. Furthermore, according to Connect6 heuristic knowledge, this paper uses relevance-zone search to accelerate identifying winning and losing moves.

The incorporation of small amounts of carbon (0.2-0.5 vol. %) into epitaxial Gd2O3 has been found to be very useful in improving the electrical properties especially by reducing the leakage current behavior. The doping has a negligible impact on the structural quality of the oxide layer. We show that the very often found adverse effect of oxygen vacancy induced defects in oxides grown at higher temperature can be eliminated by moderate amount of carbon doping during growth.	carbon;doping;epitaxial layers;leakage currents;silicon;vacancies (crystal)6172jd;6172up;6855at;7755Px,							
508	Reinforcement Learning in First Person Shooter Games	McPartland, M.; Gallagher, M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110314	Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular machine learning technique that has many successes in learning how to play classic style games. Applying RL to first person shooter (FPS) games is an interesting area of research as it has the potential to create diverse behaviors without the need to implicitly code them. This paper investigates the tabular Sarsa (?) RL algorithm applied to a purpose built FPS game. The first part of the research investigates using RL to learn bot controllers for the tasks of navigation, item collection, and combat individually. Results showed that the RL algorithm was able to learn a satisfactory strategy for navigation control, but not to the quality of the industry standard pathfinding algorithm. The combat controller performed well against a rule-based bot, indicating promising preliminary results for using RL in FPS games. The second part of the research used pretrained RL controllers and then combined them by a number of different methods to create a more generalized bot artificial intelligence (AI). The experimental results indicated that RL can be used in a generalized way to control a combination of tasks in FPS bots such as navigation, item collection, and combat.

510	Channel Identification of Concatenated Fiber-Wireless Uplink Using Ternary Signals	Yin Hoe Ng; Ai Hui Tan; Teong Chee Chuah	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20110912	In the uplink of a fiber-based wireless system, the multipath dispersion that is introduced by the wireless link and the nonlinear distortion that is caused by the radio-over-fiber (RoF) link significantly degrade system performance. Channel equalization is challenging, because these impairments are generally unknown to the receiver. One novel technique of estimating both of these impairments using ternary pseudorandom signals is proposed. The key idea is to exploit proper harmonic suppression through signal design such that errors that are inflicted by the nonlinear distortion can be eliminated or reduced. Capitalizing on this case, a simple yet effective correlation approach is applied to accurately estimate the channel impulse response. Subsequently, least squares polynomial fitting is invoked to identify the nonlinearity of the RoF link, making use of the linear estimates obtained earlier. Design guidelines that lead to good performance are proposed. Results reveal that an improvement in the estimation accuracy of at least a factor of two is achieved by the proposed technique over an existing technique utilizing binary signals in the various scenarios investigated, even if the identification period of the proposed technique is almost 1000 times shorter than the existing technique. Because the proposed technique enables a simpler transmitter structure and requires shorter identification periods and lower power transmission, it is found to be appealing for use in broadband fiber-based wireless systems.

511	Answer Set Programming for Procedural Content Generation: A Design Space Approach	Smith, A.M.; Mateas, M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110912	Procedural content generators for games produce artifacts from a latent design space. This space is often only implicitly defined, an emergent result of the procedures used in the generator. In this paper, we outline an approach to content generation that centers on explicit description of the design space, using domain-independent procedures to produce artifacts from the described space. By concisely capturing a design space as an answer set program, we can rapidly define and expressively sculpt new generators for a variety of game content domains. We walk through the reimplementation of a reference evolutionary content generator in a tutorial example, and review existing applications of answer set programming to generative-content design problems in and outside of a game context.

Levels are built out of small segments called ﾓrhythm groups,ﾔ which are generated using a two-tiered, grammar-based approach. These segments are pieced together into complete levels that are then rated according to a set of design heuristics. Generation can be controlled using a set of parameters that influence the level pacing and geometry. The approach minimizes the amount of content that must be manually authored: instead of piecing together large segments of a level, Launchpad uses base components that are commonly found in a number of 2-D platformers. Launchpad produces an impressive variety of levels which are all guaranteed to be playable.

The array employs corner-truncated microstrip patches as the basic element, and then a four-element array as the subarray. By applying the sequential rotation technique twice to design the feed networks, a full 64-element array with good performance is obtained. A prototype of the full array was constructed and tested. The measurement results show that both the reflection coefficient of less than 10 dB and axial ratio of less than 3 dB have been achieved over a frequency band of 27-31 GHz; this corresponds to a wide bandwidth of 13.8%. Due to its planar configuration, the proposed array can find good applications in aerospace, radar, and communication systems.

515	Agent-Based Optimization for Large Scale WLAN Design	McGibney, A.; Klepal, M.; Pesch, D.	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20110728	The complex nature of wireless local area networks (WLAN) design has led many of the deployments being done in an ad-hoc fashion without efficient design methodologies. Although this approach may work for a small environment with a small number of access points, it is infeasible to use such a process when designing a larger wireless infrastructure. Due to the low cost that is indicative of WLAN deployments, many practitioners view formal optimization techniques as being too complex and costly to implement. There have been a number of research works that investigate the use of formal optimization techniques for the accurate design of a WLAN. Unfortunately, the approaches taken do not address one major issue when designing a complex and demanding wireless network infrastructure, namely scalability. An optimization algorithm must consider a multitude of design criteria and therefore needs to be scalable to be successfully applied to large scenarios. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the development of a scalable optimization algorithm based on the tools of distributed artificial intelligence, which overcomes the failings of current approaches and can be utilized for WLAN design regardless of size or complexity of site specific requirements.

The algorithm first detects all the ships and replaces the pixels' gray value of the detected ship with the gray mean value. Then, with the ship target's geometric center as the center, a square image with a certain length is got, and the image is subdivided into four subimages, where the gray intensity contrast of the wake to clutter in the subimage is enhanced. Normalized Hough transform is applied on every subimage, and the probability distribution function in the Hough domain of each subimage is modeled, which can be used for CFAR detection. Finally, the detection results of the subimages are fused to get the final detection. Using our algorithm, the signal-to-clutter ratio of the wake to clutter is enhanced, the ship's navigation direction can be extracted easily, and most importantly, CFAR detection is realized.

Then we improve the construction to obtain more 2m-variable-balanced RSBFs with maximum AI, and these new RSBFs have higher non-linearity than all previously obtained RSBFs. Further, we generalise our construction of 2m-variable RSBFs to a new construction that can generate any even-variable RSBFs.

The fluorescence spectrum is attributed to fluorescent dye in the synaptic vesicles, indicating excitation by two-photon absorption of the trapping laser. The fluorescence intensity increases gradually within ?100ﾠs of laser irradiation, suggesting that trapping force causes vesicles assembly at the focus. Our method can be applied to manipulate synaptic transmission of a particular neuron in a neuronal network.	cellular biophysics;fluorescence;laser applications in medicine;neurophysiology;optical pumping;two-photon processes4262Be;8717-d;8719lg;8764kv;8780Cc;8780Dj,							
524	Simulation Analysis of Transmission-Line Impedance Transformers With the Gaussian, Exponential, and Linear Impedance Profiles for Pulsed-Power Accelerators	Yixiang Hu; Ai'ci Qiu; Tao Huang; Fengju Sun; Peitian Cong; Jiangtao Zeng; Xinjun Zhang; Tianshi Lei	Plasma Science, IEEE Transactions on	20111107	Based on the transmission-line code, a 1-D circuit model for the transmission-line impedance transformer with an arbitrary impedance profile is developed, and the simulation results are compared with those of the existing literatures. By using this model, the power efficiencies and pulse compression ratios of the transformers (with Gaussian, exponential, and linear impedance profiles) were quantified as functions of ? (the ratio of the output impedance to the input impedance of the transformers) and ? (the ratio of the pulsewidth to the one-way transit time of the transformers). The simulation results indicate that the exponential transformers have the maximum power efficiencies and pulse compression ratios. However, in the limit h h is the Gaussian parameter), the Gaussian transformers almost have the same power efficiencies and pulse compression ratios as the exponential ones. Finally, the performances of a radial transformer line in smoothing the arrival time variations in the forward-going power pulses were studied. The simulation results show that, for the cases considered, the rise time (0-1.0) of the output pulse is prolonged by about half of the maximum difference in the time at which the pulses are launched, and the reduction of the peak output power is less than 2% when the maximum difference is 30 ns.

Industry Applications, IEEE Transactions on	20110317	The operation of high energy loads on the Navy's future electric ships will cause disturbances to the main bus voltage and impact the operation of the rest of the power system. This paper describes an online design and laboratory hardware implementation of an optimal excitation controller using an artificial immune system (AIS)-based algorithm. The AIS algorithm, a clonal selection algorithm (CSA), is used to minimize the effects of pulsed loads by improved excitation control and reduce the requirement on energy storage device capacity. The CSA is implemented on the MSK2812 DSP hardware platform. A comparison of CSA and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented. Both simulation and hardware measurement results show that the CSA-optimized excitation controller provides effective control of a generator's terminal voltage during pulsed loads, restoring and stabilizing it quickly.

528	Magnetization configurations and reversal of magnetic nanotubes with opposite chiralities of the end domains	Chen, Ai-Ping; Gonzalez, Julian M.; Guslienko, Konstantin Y.	Journal of Applied Physics	20110421	For thick soft magnetic nanotubes with an anisotropy axis directed along the nanotube length the equilibrium energy ground states present magnetization configurations with opposite rotating senses in two tube ends (B-state), referring as antiparallel chiralities of the end vortex domains. For nanotubes with outer radius R of 50 nm, 100 nm and 150 nm, and length L = (2.5ﾖ20)R the B-state remanent magnetization and the reversal field dependence on tube thickness and anisotropy strength are studied by using both two-dimensional simulation and analytic methods. The equilibrium states, the hysteresis loops and the switching field values calculated numerically are presented as the functions of tube size and material parameters. For the short nanotubes the domain walls patterns, such as transverse walls and vortex walls, nucleating in the tube center, as well as the hysteresis loops of the nanotubes with transverse walls are presented. The numerical results are interpreted by a simple analytical model in which the equilibrium state of nanotube is described by ?, the angle of the magnetization M deviation from the intrinsic tube easy axis. ? as a function of the tube aspect ratio L/R, tube thickness ?R, and uniaxial anisotropy constant Ku, obtained by minimizing the total magnetic energy, well describes dependences of the shape of hysteresis loops and switching field values on the tube geometric and material parameters in the B-state.	chirality;ground states;magnetic anisotropy;magnetic hysteresis;nanomagnetics;nanotubes;remanence;soft magnetic materials7530Gw;7560Ej;7575-c,

Here, we concentrate on the first issue. By exploiting a famous image feature processing strategy, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BOV) in image semantic analysis and the artificial immune systems (AIS)'s abilities of learning and adaptability to solve complicated problems, we present a novel and effective image representation method for SAR image classification. In BOV, an effective fused feature sets for local feature representation are first formulated, which are viewed as the low-level features in it. After that, clonal selection algorithm (CSA) in AIS is introduced to optimize the prediction error of k-fold cross-validation for getting more suitable visual words from the low-level features. Finally, the BOV features are represented by the learned visual words for subsequent pattern classification. Compared with the other four algorithms, the proposed algorithm obtains more satisfactory and cogent classification experimental results.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110912	This paper presents an approach to automatic video game level design consisting of a computational model of player enjoyment and a generative system based on evolutionary computing. The model estimates the entertainment value of game levels according to the presence of ﾓrhythm groups,ﾔ which are defined as alternating periods of high and low challenge. The generative system represents a novel combination of genetic algorithms (GAs) and constraint satisfaction (CS) methods and uses the model as a fitness function for the generation of fun levels for two different games. This top-down approach improves upon typical bottom-up techniques in providing semantically meaningful parameters such as difficulty and player skill, in giving human designers considerable control over the output of the generative system, and in offering the ability to create levels for different types of games.

It is reported that various deformations have different influences on the thermal properties of carbon nanotubes. For bending carbon nanotubes, the thermal conductivity is independent of the bending angle. However, the thermal conductivity increases lightly with xy-distortion and decreases rapidly with z-distortion. The thermal conductivity does not change with the screw ratio before the breaking of carbon nanotubes, but it decreases sharply after the critical screw ratio.	bending;carbon nanotubes;distortion;molecular dynamics method;thermal conductivity6143Bn;6220F-;6670Df;8140Lm,							
534	Engineering Design of Strategies for Winning Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Competitions	Jiawei Li; Hingston, P.; Kendall, G.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20111212	In this paper, we investigate winning strategies for round-robin iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) competitions and evolutionary IPD competitions. Since the outcome of a single competition depends on the composition of the population of participants, we propose a statistical evaluation methodology that takes into account outcomes across varying compositions. We run several series of competitions in which the strategies of the participants are randomly chosen from a set of representative strategies. Statistics are gathered to evaluate the performance of each strategy. With this approach, the conditions for some well-known strategies to win a round-robin IPD competition are analyzed. We show that a strategy that uses simple rule-based identification mechanisms to explore and exploit the opponent outperforms well-known strategies such as tit-for-tat (TFT) in most round-robin competitions. Group strategies have an advantage over nongroup strategies in evolutionary IPD competitions. Group strategies adopt different strategies in interacting with kin members and nonkin members. A simple group strategy, Clique, which cooperates only with kin members, performs well in competing against well-known IPD strategies. We introduce several group strategies developed by combining Clique with winning strategies from round-robin competitions and evaluate their performance by adapting three parameters: sole survivor rate, extinction rate, and survival time. Simulation results show that these group strategies outperform well-known IPD strategies in evolutionary IPD competitions.

For a new POCT platform, a novel field effect transistor (FET)-based biosensor array was fabricated with conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Nanogap-embedded separated double-gate FETs (nanogap-DGFETs) were realized in a 6�6 array as a biosensor cartridge. Moreover, the low-noise readout circuit was designed and fabricated using a 0.35- ?m standard CMOS process. The AI antigen and antibody were bound with the aid of silica-binding proteins (SBP) in the nanogap of the biosensor device. Because the gate dielectric constant was increased by the immobilized biomolecules, the threshold voltage of the nanogap-DGFET was reduced while the drain-to-source current was enhanced. Drain-to-source currents of the nanogap-DGFET array were successfully acquired using the fabricated readout circuitry and measurement setup. This platform is suitable for a simple and effective label-free detection of AI in POCT applications.

539	TaN and    Sidewall Gate-Etch Damage Influence on Program, Erase, and Retention of Sub-50-nm TANOS nand Flash Memory Cells	Beug, M.F.; Melde, T.; Paul, J.; Knoefler, R.	Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on	20110519	The sidewall gate-etch damage influence on the electrical behavior of 48-nm TaN/AI2O3/SiN/SiO2/Si (TANOS) NAND charge-trapping memory cells is investigated in detail. This etch damage occurs at the sidewall of the high work-function TaN metal gate and high-k AI2O3 blocking-oxide layers and adversely affects the electrical performance and the mechanical stability of small-ground-rule TANOS cells. Both issues could be solved for 48-nm TANOS cells by the introduction of a new integration scheme, which includes a removable encapsulation liner. This SiN liner protects the TaN sidewall from the etch damage during the aggressive AI2O3 high-k etch process. The optimum of the 48-nm electrical cell performance was found for a 4-nm encapsulation liner thickness. In contrast to 48-nm TANOS cells, the encapsulation liner thickness does not affect the electrical performance of large 5-?m-long-and-wide memory cells. The memory cell performance dependence on the TANOS liner thickness and memory cell size is explained by a damaged AI2O3 region approximately 3-4 nm thick at the block oxide side wall. As a result, the reported etch damage exhibits a new scaling issue for TANOS memory cells around the 20-nm technology node when the total encapsulation liner thickness approaches half of the memory cell length.	$hbox{TaN}/hbox{Al}_{2}hbox{O}_{3}/hbox{SiN}/ hbox{SiO}_{2}/hbox{Si}$ (TANOS);Charge-trap memory devices;nand Flash;nonvolatile memory;oxide traps;removable encapsulation liner;trap-assisted leakage,Aluminum oxide;Bleaching;Encapsulation;High K dielectric materials;Logic gates;Programming;Silicon compounds,NAND circuits;aluminium compounds;encapsulation;etching;flash memories;silicon compounds;tantalum compoundsTANOS NAND charge-trapping memory cells;TANOS NAND flash memory cells;TANOS memory cells;TaN-Al2O3-SiN-SiO2-Si;electrical behavior;electrical cell performance;electrical performance;encapsulation liner thickness;high work-function metal gate;high-k blocking-oxide layers;high-k etch process;mechanical stability;memory cell length;memory cell performance dependence;memory cell size;program, erase, and retention;removable encapsulation liner;sidewall gate-etch damage influence;size 4 nm;size 48 nm;size 5 mum;size 50 nm;small-ground-rule TANOS cells							
540	Search-Based Procedural Generation of Maze-Like Levels	Ashlock, D.; Lee, C.; McGuinness, C.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110912	A correctly designed dynamic programming algorithm can be used as a fitness function to permit the evolution of maze-like levels for use in games. This study compares multiple representations for evolvable mazes including direct, as well as positive and negative indirect representations. The first direct representation simply specifies, with a binary gene, which squares of a grid are obstructed. The second paints the maze grid and passage is allowed only between colors that are the same or adjacent in a rainbow. The positive and negative representations are developmental and evolve directions for adding barriers or digging ﾓtunnels.ﾔ These representations are tested with a design space of fitness functions that automatically generate levels with controllable properties. Fitness function design is the most difficult part of automatic level generation and this study gives a simple framework for designing fitness functions that permits substantial control over the character of the mazes that evolve. This technique relies on using checkpoints within the maze to characterize the connectivity and path lengths within the level. Called checkpoint-based fitness, these fitness functions are built on a menu of properties that can be rewarded. The choice of which qualities are rewarded, in turn, specifies within broad limits the characteristics of the mazes to be evolved. Three of the representations are found to benefit from a technique called sparse initialization in which a maze starts mostly empty and variation operators fill in details while increasing fitness. Different representations are found to produce mazes with very different appearances, even when the same fitness function is used. The example fitness functions designed around dynamic programming with checkpoints are found to permit substantial control over the properties of the evolved mazes.

Samples were prepared by the decomposition of acetate solid solutions. By changing the concentration of dopant ions in the reaction solutions, zinc oxides with different amounts of dopant were obtained. The morphologies, chemical compositions, and structures of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray powder diffraction. Electromagnetic characteristics of the doped samples were assessed by vector network analysis at a frequency range of 2ﾖ16 GHz. Both the real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity decreased as Mn or Ni concentration increased. Results indicate that, compared with pure ZnO, Mn- and Ni-doped zinc oxides exhibit excellent microwave absorption properties. The highest level of microwave absorption observed was 80.7 dB at a frequency of 9.8 GHz, and the best frequency bandwidth was 8.6 GHz at reflection loss values below -10 dB.

543	Transforming Complete Coverage Algorithms to Partial Coverage Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks	Yingshu Li; Chinh Vu; Chunyu Ai; Guantao Chen; Yi Zhao	Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20110224	The complete area coverage problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has been extensively studied in the literature. However, many applications do not require complete coverage all the time. For such applications, one effective method to save energy and prolong network lifetime is to partially cover the area. This method for prolonging network lifetime recently attracts much attention. However, due to the hardness of verifying the coverage ratio, all the existing centralized or distributed but nonparallel algorithms for partial coverage have very high time complexities. In this work, we propose a framework which can transform almost any existing complete coverage algorithm to a partial coverage one with any coverage ratio by running a complete coverage algorithm to find full coverage sets with virtual radii and converting the coverage sets to partial coverage sets via adjusting sensing radii. Our framework can preserve the characteristics of the original algorithms and the conversion process has low time complexity. The framework also guarantees some degree of uniform partial coverage of the monitored area.

544	Distributed Intrusion Detection System in a Multi-Layer Network Architecture of Smart Grids	Yichi Zhang; Lingfeng Wang; Weiqing Sun; Green, R.C.; Alam, M.	Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on	20111121	The advent of the smart grid promises to usher in an era that will bring intelligence, efficiency, and optimality to the power grid. Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless mesh network technologies with the 802.15.4, 802.11, and WiMAX standards. Each of these will expose the power grid to cybersecurity threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid-the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)-where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks. AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection. Simulation results demonstrate that this is a promising methodology for supporting the optimal communication routing and improving system security through the identification of malicious network traffic.

548	Ship Surveillance With TerraSAR-X	Brusch, S.; Lehner, S.; Fritz, T.; Soccorsi, M.; Soloviev, A.; van Schie, B.	Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20110222	Ship detection is an important application of global monitoring of environment and security. In order to overcome the limitations by other systems, surveillance with satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is used because of its possibility to provide ship detection at high resolution over wide swaths and in all weather conditions. A new X-band radar onboard the TerraSAR-X (TS-X) satellite gives access to spatial resolution as fine as 1 m. In this paper, first results on the combined use of TS-X ship detection, automatic identification system (AIS), and satellite AIS (SatAIS) is presented. The AIS system is an effective terrestrial method for tracking vessels in real time typically up to 40 km off the coast. SatAIS, as a space-based system, allows almost global coverage for monitoring of ships since not all ships operate their AIS and smaller ships are not equipped with AIS. The system is considered to be of cooperative nature. In this paper, the quality of TS-X images with respect to ship detection is evaluated, and a first assessment of its performance for ship detection is given. The velocity of a moving ship is estimated using complex TS-X data. As test cases, images were acquired over the North Sea, Baltic Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Pacific Ocean in Stripmap mode with a resolution of 3 m at a coverage of 30 km 100 km. Simultaneous information on ship positions was available from TS-X and terrestrial as well as SatAIS. First results on the simultaneous superposition of SatAIS and high-resolution radar images are presented.

550	Image Processing to Eliminate Crosstalk Between Neighboring View Images in Three-Dimensional Lenticular Display	Xiao-Fang Li; Qiong-Hua Wang; Da-Hai Li; Ai-Hong Wang	Display Technology, Journal of	20110627	In the multiview autostereoscopic 3D lenticular displays, the crosstalk between the neighboring view images at each view image's optimal viewing position influences the image quality and lowers the visual comfort of observers. A method is proposed to eliminate the crosstalk by correcting the intensity values of subpixels on synthetic images. We analyze the causes of crosstalk based on a synthetic image and deduce the equations of crosstalk elimination according to the relationship between the crosstalk coefficients of each view image observed through the lenticular sheet, the intensity values of subpixels displayed on the synthetic images, and the intensity values of subpixels observed through the lenticular sheet at the optimal viewing position. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The method for crosstalk elimination is by means of image processing, and it does not change the parameters of the lenticular lens and the structure of the display screen.

551	Effective Racing on Partially Observable Tracks: Indirectly Coupling Anticipatory Egocentric Sensors With Motor Commands	Butz, M.V.; Linhardt, M.J.; Lo&#x0308;nneker, T.D.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110314	The TORCS-based Simulated Car Racing Championship (SCRC) poses a demanding challenge for designing an effective racing car controller. Controllers do not receive any global track information, but only perceive simulated, car-centered sensory information about the current, local track properties and about surrounding opponents. Our racing controller, termed COgnitive BOdySpaces: TORCS-based Adaptive Racing (COBOSTAR), uses the sensors that give the most anticipatory information to learn a sensory-to-motor policy, which was optimized by means of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). The basic policy was extended by additional modules to prevent detrimental skidding, to safely land after jumps, to implement effective opponent avoidance, and to recover and learn online from accidents. Owing to this approach, COBOSTAR won two out of the three competition legs of the 2009 SCRC and, without hardly any further modifications, also was among the first in the 2010 SCRC despite the addition of noise to the utilized sensors. This paper describes the COBOSTAR controller as it was submitted to the last of the three competition legs in 2009. Evaluations of distinct controller modules are provided where possible. A future outlook summarizes the lessons learned during the design of the racer and proposes the utilization of the framework also in broader research and application contexts.

554	Evolving Coordination for Real-Time Strategy Games	Keaveney, D.; O'Riordan, C.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110613	The aim of this work is to show that evolutionary computation techniques (genetic programming in this case) can be used to evolve coordination in real-time strategy games. An abstract real-time strategy game is used for our experiments, similar to a board game but with many of the properties that define real-time strategy games. We develop an automated player that uses a progressive refinement planning technique when determining its next immediate turn in our abstract real-time strategy game. We describe two types of coordination which we believe are important in the game and then define measurements for both. We perform twenty coevolutionary runs for our automated player and then analyze the history of each run with respect to the success of the solutions found and their level of coordination. We wish to show that as the evolutionary process progresses both the quality and the level of coordination in the solutions found increases.

555	Modeling the Dynamics of Coalition Formation Games for Cooperative Spectrum Sharing in an Interference Channel	Khan, Z.; Glisic, S.; DaSilva, L.A.; Lehtoma&#x0308;ki, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110314	Although establishing cooperation in a wireless network is a dynamic process, most game theoretic coalition formation models proposed in the literature are static. We analyze a dynamic coalition formation game based on a Markovian model for the spectrum sharing problem in an interference channel. Our model is dynamic in the sense that distributed transmitter/receiver pairs, with partial channel knowledge, reach stable coalition structures (CSs) through a time-evolving sequence of steps. Depending on an interference environment, we show that the game process either converges to the absorbing state of the grand coalition or to the absorbing state of internal and external stability. We also show that, due to myopic links, it is possible that the core of the game is nonempty, but links cannot form the grand coalition to utilize the core rate allocations. We then formulate a condition for the formation of the stable grand coalition. Using simulation we show that coalition formation yields significant gains in terms of average rates per link for different network sizes. We also show average maximum coalition sizes for different distances between the transmitters and their own receivers. Finally, we analyze the mean and variance of the time for the game to reach the stable coalition structures.

556	Adaptivity Challenges in Games and Simulations: A Survey	Lopes, R.; Bidarra, R.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110613	In computer games and simulations, content is often rather static and rigid. As a result, its prescripted nature can lead to predictable and impersonal gameplay, while alienating unconventional players. Adaptivity in games has therefore been recently proposed to overcome these shortcomings and make games more challenging and appealing. In this paper, we survey present research on game adaptivity, identifying, and discussing the main challenges, and pointing out some of the most promising directions ahead. We first survey the purposes of adaptivity, as the principles that could steer an adaptation and generation engine. From this perspective, we proceed to thoroughly discuss adaptivity's targets and methods. Current advances and successes in this emerging field point to many yet unexplored research opportunities. Among them, we discuss the use of gameplay expectations, learning preferences, and assessment data in the integrated adaptation of game worlds, scenarios, and quests. We conclude that, among other methods, procedural content generation and semantic modeling can powerfully combine to create offline customized content and online adjustments to game worlds, scenarios, and quests. These and other promising methods, deserving ample research efforts, can therefore, be expected to significantly contribute towards making games and simulations even more unpredictable, effective, and fun.

558	Strong in-plane anisotropy of magneto-optical Kerr effect in corrugated cobalt films deposited on highly ordered two-dimensional colloidal crystals	Han, Z.L.; Ai, J.H.; Zhan, P.; Du, J.; Ding, H.F.; Wang, Z.L.	Applied Physics Letters	20110124	The corrugated cobalt films are investigated by magneto-optical Kerr effect and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The films are fabricated by depositing thin cobalt layers on a large area single-domain two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal close-packing colloidal crystal. Strong in-plane anisotropy of the Kerr rotation hysteresis loop is found in sharp contrast to isotropic hysteresis loops obtained by the VSM. The anisotropy of such magneto-optical Kerr rotation disappears when randomly distributed colloidal spheres were used as the substrate. Our observations show that the magneto-optical effect does not completely correspond with the average magnetization state in such a 2D periodic magnetic network.

562	High performance solar cell based on ultra-thin poly(3-hexylthiophene): Fullerene film without thermal and solvent annealing	Wu, Zhongwei; Song, Tao; Jin, Yizheng; Sun, Baoquan	Applied Physics Letters	20111006	A method has been developed to fabricate organic solar cell based on poly(3-hexylthiopene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) film with a thickness as thin as ?60 nm. The P3HT chain ordering can be dramatically enhanced by slow solvent evaporation process, which is verified by obvious vibronic features and enhanced absorption capability. Due to the improvement of P3HT chain ordering degree, the solar cell based on ultrathin film achieves the power conversion efficiency of 3.7%. Furthermore, the fabrication process does not require any post-treatments such as solvent-vapor or thermal annealing process, which is more compatible with future plastic substrates.	fullerene compounds;polymer blends;solar cells;vibronic states8840hj;8840jr,							
563	The Modified Riccati Equation for Amplitude-Aided Target Tracking in Heavy-Tailed Clutter	Brekke, E.; Hallingstad, O.; Glattetre, J.	Aerospace and Electronic Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20111006	The performance of tracking methods can most often only be assessed by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. An exception to this rule is the popular probabilistic data association filter (PDAF), whose root mean square error (RMSE) can be predicted by means of the modified Riccati equation (MRE). To the best of our knowledge, the first treatment along these lines for the PDAF with amplitude information (PDAFAI) is presented here. We evaluate the MRE with amplitude information (AI) for the case of a Swerling I target in heavy-tailed, or more precisely K-distributed, background noise. The MRE can be used to determine an optimal nominal false alarm rate. To the best of our knowledge, the first systematic approach to the determination of false alarm rates in heavy-tailed clutter is presented here. In particular, it is indicated that the PDAFAI can safely operate in the presence of very abundant clutter, while the PDAF only can cope with limited amounts of clutter.	,Artificial intelligence;Kinematics;Logic gates;Monte Carlo methods;Noise measurement;Riccati equations;Target tracking,Monte Carlo methods;Riccati equations;filters;noise;probability;target trackingK-distributed noise;Monte-Carlo simulations;Swerling I target;amplitude information;amplitude-aided target tracking;background noise;heavy-tailed clutter;modified Riccati equation;probabilistic data association filter;root mean square error							
564	p-type doping effect on the performance of organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells	Lei, Xiaofei; Zhang, Fute; Song, Tao; Sun, Baoquan	Applied Physics Letters	20111212	The doping effects in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) on the hybrid n-Si/P3HT solar cells were investigated. Oxygen and tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) doping in P3HT could dramatically improve the device performance. The improvements were related to the Fermi level shift in P3HT towards its highest occupied molecular orbital, leading to a larger built-in voltage generated at the n-Si/P3HT interface for favorable charge transfer. This Fermi level shift was ascribed to the electron transfer from P3HT to the dopant, which was characterized by the absorption spectra and the photoluminescence lifetime. Solution-based F4-TCNQ displayed as a potential candidate to p-doped conjugated polymer to improve charge transfer/transport properties for the hybrid solar cells.

566	Improved Performance of Yttrium-Doped    as Inter-Poly Dielectric for Flash-Memory Applications	Huang, X.D.; Liu, L.; Xu, J.P.; Lai, P.T.	Device and Materials Reliability, IEEE Transactions on	20110905	Yttrium-doped Al2O3 (YxAIyO) with different yttrium contents prepared by co-sputtering method is investigated as the inter-poly dielectric (IPD) for flash memory applications. A poor SiO2-like interlayer formed at the IPD/Si interface is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and can be sup pressed by Y doping through the transformation of silica into silicate. Compared with Al2O3 and Y2O3 films, the optimized YxAIyO film shows lower interface-state density, lower bulk charge-trapping density, higher dielectric constant, and smaller gate leakage, due to the suppressed interlayer and good thermal property ascribed to appropriate Y and Al contents in the film. Therefore, the optimized YxAIyO film is a promising candidate as the IPD for flash memory.	$hbox{Y}_{x}hbox{Al}_{y}hbox{O}$;Flash memory;high-dielectric constant (high- $k$);inter-poly dielectric (IPD);yttrium doping,Aluminum oxide;Dielectric films;Dielectrics;Flash memory;Silicon;Sputtering,dielectric materials;flash memories;semiconductor doping;yttriumAl2O3;SiO2;X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy;Y2O3;charge-trapping density;cosputtering method;dielectric constant;doping;flash memory application;flash-memory application;gate leakage;inter-poly dielectric;interface-state density;thermal property;yttrium contents							
567	Effects of surface tension on the size-dependent ferroelectric characteristics of free-standing BaTiO3 nano-thin films	Su, Yu; Chen, Haitao; Li, Jacqueline J.; Soh, Ai Kah; Weng, George J.	Journal of Applied Physics	20111212	Intrinsic surface tension of nanoscale ferroelectric thin film tends to induce tensile stress in its surface layer, whereas the other portion of the film is subjected to compression to maintain mechanical balance. A continuum-based phase-field model accounting for such surface effect has been set up to investigate the evolution of domain structure and thickness-dependent ferroelectric properties of free-standing BaTiO3 nano-thin films. It was observed that both remnant polarization and coercive field decrease with a decrease of film thickness and increase of surface tension, and that, for film thickness ranging from 10-20 nm, both properties decreased sharply at the surface strain 2-3?0 (?0 being the spontaneous strain). Further decrease in film thickness or increase in surface tension could result in loss of ferroelectricity. Such a critical state for the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition has also been established for the range of film thickness 4-20 nm.	barium compounds;dielectric polarisation;electric domains;ferroelectric coercive field;ferroelectric thin films;ferroelectric transitions;nanostructured materials;permittivity;stress-strain relations;surface tension;tensile strength7722Ch;7722Ej;7780Dj;7780bn;7784Cg;8140Jj,							
568	Novel statistical criteria for local mean power estimation in wireless coverage prediction	Ai, B.; Zhong, Z.D.; Zhu, G.; Zhao, M.	Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation, IET	20110512	Much research on the estimation of local mean power is based on Lee's criteria. However, there are some restrictions for Lee's criteria in practical applications. Aiming at enhancing the wireless coverage prediction efficiently, novel statistical criteria including statistical interval, sampling distance, confidence level and number of measurement runs in wireless field coverage prediction are established. In contrast to previous criteria, in which a non-correlation property between sampling points is assumed, an evaluation equation to determine the lower and upper bound of the statistical interval is proposed. Moreover, no previous work has mentioned the confidence level and the number of measurement runs that will introduce estimation errors in the prediction process. The authors will take these factors into consideration to establish the novel criteria for the setting of the confidence level and the number of measurement runs. These criteria are of importance owing to their contribution to wireless network planning and optimisation. In addition, the novel criteria present reasonable explanations as to why some tighter sampling distances, such as 3, 4 and 6 cm in 900 MHz working frequency, can be adopted in the high speed railway construction in China and in certain European countries. However, such tighter sampling distances do not meet the present requirement for sampling distance in local mean power estimation, which is 26  37 cm in 900 MHz working frequency. The authors will explain the reason through theoretical analysis and simulation.	mobile radio;statistical analysis;telecommunication network planningLee criteria;error estimation;frequency 900 MHz;local mean power estimation;sampling distance;statistical criteria;statistical interval;wireless coverage prediction;wireless network optimisation;wireless network planning							
569	Primary input cones based on test sequences in synchronous sequential circuits	Pomeranz, I.; Reddy, S.M.	Computers & Digital Techniques, IET	20101223	When an output bi of a combinational circuit depends on a subset of inputs Ai, it is sufficient to specify values for inputs included in Ai during test generation for faults in the input cone of bi, which are detectable on bi. This property can be used to facilitate off-line and built-in test generation, and enhance test compaction, test data compression and test power reduction. In this work the authors investigate an analogous property of test sequences for synchronous sequential circuits. The authors demonstrate that a test subsequence for a target fault may need to specify values only for a subset of primary inputs, leaving the remaining primary inputs unspecified at all the time units of the test subsequence. Furthermore, test sequences obtained for different circuits by specifying different subsets of primary inputs in different parts of the sequence have certain common properties that are highlighted by the use of incompletely specified primary input vectors. These properties can be expressed in a circuit-independent form. The usefulness of these properties is demonstrated by using them as part of a simulation-based test generation procedure. The authors also discuss properties of the subsets of primary inputs that are useful in detecting target faults when their values are specified. These properties can be used to define primary input cones for a synchronous sequential circuit.	automatic test pattern generation;combinational circuits;sequential circuitscombinational circuit;primary input cones;synchronous sequential circuit;test compaction;test data compression;test generation;test power reduction;test sequence

Applied Physics Letters	20110421	We report the characteristics of HfAlO films deposited on S- and GeO2-passivated Ge substrates at 150 ﾰC by atomic layer deposition technique using Hf(NO3)4 and Al(CH3)3 as the precursors. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses reveal that GeO2 passivation is more effective to suppress GeOx formation than S passivation. It is demonstrated that the capacitors with GeO2 passivation exhibit better electrical properties with less hysteresis, improved interface quality, and reduced leakage current. These results indicate that using GeO2 as an interfacial layer may be a promising approach for the realization of high quality Ge-based transistor devices.

572	A Local-Concentration-Based Feature Extraction Approach for Spam Filtering	Yuanchun Zhu; Ying Tan	Information Forensics and Security, IEEE Transactions on	20110516	Inspired from the biological immune system, we propose a local concentration (LC)-based feature extraction approach for anti-spam. The LC approach is considered to be able to effectively extract position-correlated information from messages by transforming each area of a message to a corresponding LC feature. Two implementation strategies of the LC approach are designed using a fixed-length sliding window and a variable-length sliding window. To incorporate the LC approach into the whole process of spam filtering, a generic LC model is designed. In the LC model, two types of detector sets are at first generated by using term selection methods and a well-defined tendency threshold. Then a sliding window is adopted to divide the message into individual areas. After segmentation of the message, the concentration of detectors is calculated and taken as the feature for each local area. Finally, all the features of local areas are combined as a feature vector of the message. To evaluate the proposed LC model, several experiments are conducted on five benchmark corpora using the cross-validation method. It is shown that the LC approach cooperates well with three term selection methods, which endows it with flexible applicability in the real world. Compared to the global-concentration-based approach and the prevalent bag-of-words approach, the LC approach has better performance in terms of both accuracy and F1 measure. It is also demonstrated that the LC approach is robust against messages with variable message length.

575	Structure and properties of nanocrystalline ZrNxOy thin films: Effect of the oxygen content and film thickness	Lan, Kuan-Che; Hunag, Jia-Hong; Chi-Fong Ai; Yu, Ge-Ping	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films	20110322	The main objective of this study was to investigate the structure and properties of ZrNxOy thin films associated with oxygen content and film thickness. ZrNxOy thin films were deposited using hollow cathode discharge ion plating on Si (100) substrate. The thickness of ZrNxOy films increased with increasing oxygen flow rate, ranging from 143 to 894 nm. Phase separation from ZrNxOy to ZrN and monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) was observed by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrical and mechanical properties were influenced by the film thickness and the amount of separated phase, m-ZrO2. ZrNxOy thin films with smaller thickness or deposited at higher O2 flow rate were found to have higher electrical resistivity. Hardness of the ZrNxOy thin films increased with increasing thickness, which could be related to microstructure change of the thin films. Residual stress of the ZrN phase in the ZrNxOy thin films, measured using the modified sin2 ? XRD method, decreased with increasing oxygen flow rate.

577	Improvement of electrical tree resistance of LDPE by mixed addition of nanoparticles and phthalocyanine	Yamano, Y.; Iizuka, M.	Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, IEEE Transactions on	20110131	Resistance to the electrical tree in the insulating material of mixed addition polymer nanocomposite was studied under ac high-voltage application. The polymer nanocomposite was made by the mixed addition of AI2O3 nanoparticle ('Al') and phthalocyanine compound ('Pc') into LDPE. Any coupling agent to avoid the clusters of 'Al' and 'Pc' was not used in the preparation of the test sample. The experimental results indicated that the tree initiation voltages (TIVs) for the 'Pc' and 'Al' mixed addition and the 'Pc' single addition (LDPE with 'Pc' only) were about 1.8 times higher than that for the base polymer. However, TIV for the 'Al' single addition did not significantly increase. The results suggested that the increase in TIV for the mixed addition composite is due to the existence of 'Pc' in the polymer, the mechanism of which was discussed basing on the effects of large ?-electron cloud in the molecule of 'Pc' and the effect of semi conductive characteristics of 'Pc' crystallite. On the other hand, the period of time from the tree initiation to the breakdown for the mixed addition was almost 10 times longer than that for the base polymer. In the cases of the single addition, the period of time to the breakdown for the 'Al' single addition was about 3 times longer than that for the base polymer, and the period of time for the 'Pc' single addition was almost the same as that for the base polymer. AFM observation suggested that the well dispersion of 'Al' (nanoparticle) in the polymer is achieved in the mixed addition composite which leads to the wide area of the interface between 'Al' and LDPE. The wide area of the interface was found to control the propagation of tree and accordingly provides the long period of time to breakdown. Consequently, both the increase in TIV and the long period of time to the breakdown were obtained by the mixed addition polymer nanocomposite.

578	Evolution of Strategies With Different Representation Schemes in a Spatial Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game	Ishibuchi, H.; Ohyanagi, H.; Nojima, Yusuke	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110314	The iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game has been frequently used to examine the evolution of cooperative behavior among agents in the field of evolutionary computation. It has been demonstrated that various factors are related to the evolution of cooperative behavior. One well-known factor is spatial relations among agents. The IPD game is often played in a 2-D grid world. Such a spatial IPD game has a neighborhood structure, which is used to choose opponents for the IPD game and parents for genetic operations. Another important factor is the choice of a representation scheme to encode the strategy of each agent. Different representation schemes often lead to different results. Whereas the choice of a representation scheme is known to be important, a mixture of different representation schemes has not been examined for the spatial IPD game in the literature. That is, a population of homogeneous agents with the same representation scheme has been usually assumed in the literature. In this paper, we introduce the use of different representation schemes in a single population to the spatial IPD game in order to examine the evolution of cooperative behavior under more general assumptions. With the use of different representation schemes, we can examine the evolution of cooperative behavior in various settings such as partial interaction through the IPD game, partial interaction through crossover, full interaction through the IPD game and crossover, and no interaction between different subpopulations of agents.

The improved Doppler beam sharpening imaging algorithm is used to produce a sequence of individual subimages of ocean waves in the same scan region from different aspect angles with a high revisit rate. These subimages have an inherent property that they are formed at different discretely delayed times. Therefore, wave propagation direction can be determined from a pair of wave images in different scans. Several different methods are applied to the real airborne radar wave data, including the methods of scan sum (taking the standard Fourier spectrum of the scan-summed image), spectral sum, spectral phase shift, and cross-correlation function of subimages. The processing results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.

581	Current-induced domain wall motion in permalloy nanowires with a rectangular cross-section	Ai, J. H.; Miao, B. F.; Sun, L.; You, B.; Hu, An; Ding, H. F.	Journal of Applied Physics	20111212	We performed micromagnetic simulations of the current-induced domain wall motion in permalloy nanowires with rectangular cross-section. In the absence of the nonadiabatic spin-transfer term, a threshold current, Jc is required to drive the domain wall moving continuously. We find that Jc is proportional to the maximum cross product of the demagnetization field and magnetization orientation of the domain wall and the domain wall width. With varying both the wire thickness and width, a minimum threshold current in the order of 106 A/cm2 is obtained when the thickness is equivalent to the wire width. With the nonadiabatic spin-transfer term, the calculated domain wall velocity ? equals to the adiabatic spin transfer velocity u when the current is far above the Walker limit Jw. Below Jw, ?=ﾠ?ﾠﾠ?ﾠu, where ? is the nonadiabatic parameter and ? is the damping factor. For different ?, we find the Walker limit can be scaled as Jw=ﾠ?ﾠﾠ?-?ﾠJc. Our simulations agree well with the one dimensional analytical calculation, suggesting the findings are the general behaviors of the systems in this particular geometry.

582	Measurement of VFTO Based on the Transformer Bushing Sensor	Guo-ming Ma; Cheng-rong Li; Jiang-Tao Quan; Jian Jiang	Power Delivery, IEEE Transactions on	20110324	Disconnector switching operations in large gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) systems may produce very fast transient overvoltages (VFTOs), causing high electric stress to other apparatuses in the substation, such as power transformers. This paper presents a VFTO measuring technique based on a transformer bushing sensor, which consists of the transformer bushing (C1) and a capacitor sensor (C2) installed at the test tap of transformer bushing. In order to solve the problem of the frequency limitation of the transformer bushing sensor for measuring VFTO, a convolution model on the square-wave response of the transformer bushing sensor is introduced to obtain the frequency response of the transformer bushing sensor, and a deconvolution model based on the incremental Wiener filter is applied to reconstruct the input transient voltage waveform at the tip of the bushing by using the output signals from the bushing sensor. A 110-kV transformer bushing sensor and a fast transient overvoltage source are built in our laboratory. The results from the laboratory indicate that a transient voltage can be measured correctly based on our technique with the 110-kV transformer bushing sensor. A 750-kV transformer bushing sensor is built in a 750-kV substation. The measuring results from the 750-kV substation by using our technique show that the peak value of the VFTO produced by the disconnector (AIS) switching off operations is about 775 kV, and the dominant oscillating frequencies of the VFTO are 3.5 MHz, 1.6 MHz, and 650 kHz.

584	Automatic Track Generation for High-End Racing Games Using Evolutionary Computation	Loiacono, D.; Cardamone, L.; Lanzi, P.L.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110912	In this paper, we investigate the application of evolutionary computation to the automatic generation of tracks for high-end racing games. The idea underlying our approach is that diversity is a major source of challenge/interest for racing tracks and, eventually, might play a key role in contributing to the player's fun. In particular, we focus on the diversity of a track in terms of its shape (i.e., the number and the assortment of turns and straights it contains), and in terms of driving experience it provides (i.e., the range of speeds achievable while driving on the track). We define two fitness functions that capture our idea of diversity as the entropy of the track's curvature and speed profiles. We apply both a single-objective and a multiobjective real-coded genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve tracks involving both a wide variety of turns and straights and also a large range of driving speeds. The results we report show that both single-objective and multiobjective approaches can successfully evolve tracks with a high degree of diversity both in terms of shape and achievable speeds.

585	Radiometric Timing of High-Voltage Circuit-Breaker Opening Operations	Meier, S.D.; Moore, P.J.; Coventry, P.F.	Power Delivery, IEEE Transactions on	20110623	This paper demonstrates the feasibility of radiometric on-line circuit breaker timing. The timing test is crucial and can reveal a wide range of faults or defects. The work presented concentrates on the timing of gas-insulated substation (GIS) circuit breakers, which due to their enclosed nature pose a variety of challenges not encountered in air insulated substations (AIS). It is demonstrated how key events in the arcing process such as arc ignition and extinctions can be identified from the emitted electromagnetic pulses and how this information can be used to assess the integrity of the circuit breaker being monitored. The results are backed by site measurements of a high voltage reactor switching SF6 double pole puffer breaker. The proposed technique can readily be extended to monitor closing operations as well as being adapted to monitor other types of circuit breakers.

586	Record High-Temperature Long-Pulse Operation of 8xx-nm Diode Laser Bar with Aluminum-Free Active Region	Li Fan; Chuanshun Cao; Thaler, G.; Caliva, B.; Ai, I.; Das, S.; Walker, R.; Linfei Zeng; McElhinney, M.; Thiagarajan, P.	Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, IEEE Journal of	20111205	We report on the first demonstration of long-pulse (milliseconds) operation of aluminum-free active-region 8xx-nm diode laser bar at heat-sink temperature of 180 ﾰC. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest published operating temperature for a long-pulse 8xx-nm laser bar with Al-free active region. The laser bars have very robust performance at 130 ﾰC without any active cooling. At this high temperature, the laser bars provide both high peak power (60 W at 100 A) and good pulse shape for tens of milliseconds pulse width, maintaining high energy per pulse. The dependence of laser output pulse shape on the pulse width and pump current is experimentally investigated at 130 ﾰC. We find that the transient output power of the laser bar follows P(t) = A exp(-t /t0) + Bt + C, where A, B, C, and t 0 are fitting parameters that are pulse width and current dependent. We have also investigated the transient thermal behavior of the laser bar at high temperature and high pump current.

587	Human Computation		Human Computation	20140702	Human computation is a new and evolving research area that centers around harnessing human intelligence to solve computational problems that are beyond the scope of existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. With the growth of the Web, human computation systems can now leverage the abilities of an unprecedented number of people via the Web to perform complex computation. There are various genres of human computation applications that exist today. Games with a purpose (e.g., the ESP Game) specifically target online gamers who generate useful data (e.g., image tags) while playing an enjoyable game. Crowdsourcing marketplaces (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) are human computation systems that coordinate workers to perform tasks in exchange for monetary rewards. In identity verification tasks, users perform computation in order to gain access to some online content; an example is reCAPTCHA, which leverages millions of users who solve CAPTCHAs every day to correct words in books that ptical character recognition (OCR) programs fail to recognize with certainty. This book is aimed at achieving four goals: (1) defining human computation as a research area; (2) providing a comprehensive review of existing work; (3) drawing connections to a wide variety of disciplines, including AI, Machine Learning, HCI, Mechanism/Market Design and Psychology, and capturing their unique perspectives on the core research questions in human computation; and (4) suggesting promising research directions for the future.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110613	We present an application of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for the game of Ms Pac-Man. Contrary to most applications of MCTS to date, Ms Pac-Man requires almost real-time decision making and does not have a natural end state. We approached the problem by performing Monte Carlo tree searches on a five player maxn tree representation of the game with limited tree search depth. We performed a number of experiments using both the MCTS game agents (for pacman and ghosts) and agents used in previous work (for ghosts). Performance-wise, our approach gets excellent scores, outperforming previous non-MCTS opponent approaches to the game by up to two orders of magnitude.

By adjusting the polarization state of the lasing light launched into the PBS, the multiwavelength switchable operation can be easily achieved. When the proposed comb filter was incorporated into the laser cavity, up to 11 multiwavelength switchable lasing lines with a channel spacing of 1.2 nm were obtained. In addition, the lasing locations and the number of the lasing lines can be flexibly tuned by exploiting the wavelength-dependent loss mechanism.

Part of the cladding of the twin-core fiber over a small length is removed by chemical etching to make the effective refractive index of the fundamental mode of the side core is sensitive to the ambient refractive index. Therefore, the interference spectrum between the central core and the side core shifts with the variation of the ambient refractive index. The sensitivity of such a Michelson interferometer is  270 nm/RIU in the range of 1.34-1.38.

596	Estimation of Rotor Position and Speed of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors With Guaranteed Stability	Ortega, R.; Praly, L.; Astolfi, A.; Junggi Lee; Kwanghee Nam	Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20110415	The control algorithms used in high performance ac drives require the knowledge of rotor position and, in the case of speed regulation, also of speed. Since in many applications rotational transducers cannot be installed, their reconstruction is needed. The use of observers is stymied by the fact that the dynamics of electrical machines are highly nonlinear and does not belong to the class studied by the nonlinear control community. In this paper solutions to both problems, which are particularly tailored for the widely popular permanent magnet synchronous motors, are provided. A key step for the design of both observers is the choice of a suitable set of coordinates. The position observer is a standard gradient search whose detailed analysis reveals outstanding (global asymptotic) stability properties. Furthermore, the analysis clearly exhibits the interplay between rotor speed and the gain of the gradient search-that (essentially) determines its convergence rate. The position observer is a simple two-dimensional nonlinear system, hence is easily implementable. The speed observer is designed following the immersion and invariance technique and is also shown to be globally convergent. Simulation and experimental results of the position observer, used together with a classical field-oriented control algorithm, are presented.

600	Dynamic Game Difficulty Scaling Using Adaptive Behavior-Based AI	Chin Hiong Tan; Kay Chen Tan; Tay, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20111212	Games are played by a wide variety of audiences. Different individuals will play with different gaming styles and employ different strategic approaches. This often involves interacting with nonplayer characters that are controlled by the game AI. From a developer's standpoint, it is important to design a game AI that is able to satisfy the variety of players that will interact with the game. Thus, an adaptive game AI that can scale the difficulty of the game according to the proficiency of the player has greater potential to customize a personalized and entertaining game experience compared to a static game AI. In particular, dynamic game difficulty scaling refers to the use of an adaptive game AI that performs game adaptations in real time during the game session. This paper presents two adaptive algorithms that use ideas from reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation to improve player satisfaction by scaling the difficulty of the game AI while the game is being played. The effects of varying the learning and mutation rates are examined and a general rule of thumb for the parameters is proposed. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated to be capable of matching its opponents in terms of mean scores and winning percentages. Both algorithms are able to generalize well to a variety of opponents.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20111212	In this paper, we present a strategic bidding framework for repeated auctions with monitoring and entry fees. We motivate and formally define the desired properties of our framework and present a recursive bidding algorithm, according to which buyers learn to avoid submitting bids in stages where they have a relatively low chance of winning the auctioned item. The proposed bidding strategies are computationally simple as players do not need to recompute the sequential strategies from the data collected to date. Pursuing the proposed efficient bidding (EB) algorithm, players monitor their relative performance in the course of the game and submit their bids based on their current estimate of the market condition. We prove the stability and robustness of the proposed strategies and show that they dominate myopic and random bidding strategies using an experiment in search engine marketing.

605	Experimental Demonstration of Current Mirrors Based on Silicon Nanowire Transistors for Inversion and Subthreshold Operations	Ru Huang; Jibin Zou; Runsheng Wang; Chunhui Fan; Yujie Ai; Jing Zhuge; Yangyuan Wang	Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on	20110919	In this brief, the silicon nanowire transistor (SNWT)-based circuits of current mirrors (NWCMs) have been successfully fabricated for the first time. The key figures of merit of current mirrors (CMs) are experimentally studied, including output voltage coefficient (OVC), output resistance, and dc matching error ?. The experimental results indicate that, due to the unique quasi-1-D transport properties of the SNWTs, NWCMs exhibit superior performance than planar metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect-transistor-based CMs (PCMs) in the inversion operation region. Furthermore, NWCMs operating in the subthreshold region shows even better performance than PCMs. With the inherent advantages of the gate-all-around structure, the SNWT is very promising for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits and particularly has its unique potential at subthreshold operation for low-power applications.

606	Railway Cognitive Radio	Amanna, A.; Gadhiok, M.; Price, M.J.; Reed, J.H.; Siriwongpairat, W.P.; Himsoon, T.K.	Vehicular Technology Magazine, IEEE	20101104	Wireless communication plays a vital role in the success of railroad operations. This article describes an effort toward developing a railroad-specific cognitive radio (rail-CR) that can meet the needs of future wireless communication systems for railways by making positive train control (PTC) communication more interoperable, robust, reliable, spectrally efficient, and less costly to deploy and maintain. Cognitive radios (CRs) are a cutting-edge research area that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with software-defined radios (SDRs) with the goal of improving upon existing radio performance. SDRs are radios in which capabilities are flexible because of realizing some functionality in software as opposed to a purely hardware platform. By using situational awareness from the radio in the form of observable parameters, often known as meters, a cognitive engine (CE) uses software-based decision-making and learning algorithms to determine whether a change in the radio parameters, commonly referred to as knobs, is required based on sets of predefined goals.	cognitive radio;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile communication;railway engineering;telecommunication computingartificial intelligence;cognitive engine;learning algorithms;positive train control;railroad operations;railway cognitive radio;situational awareness;software-based decision-making;software-defined radios;wireless communication							
607	Body Schema in Robotics: A Review	Hoffmann, M.; Marques, H.G.; Hernandez Arieta, A.; Sumioka, H.; Lungarella, M.; Pfeifer, R.	Autonomous Mental Development, IEEE Transactions on	20101210	How is our body imprinted in our brain? This seemingly simple question is a subject of investigations of diverse disciplines, psychology, and philosophy originally complemented by neurosciences more recently. Despite substantial efforts, the mysteries of body representations are far from uncovered. The most widely used notions-body image and body schema-are still waiting to be clearly defined. The mechanisms that underlie body representations are coresponsible for the admiring capabilities that humans or many mammals can display: combining information from multiple sensory modalities, controlling their complex bodies, adapting to growth, failures, or using tools. These features are also desirable in robots. This paper surveys the body representations in biology from a functional or computational perspective to set ground for a review of the concept of body schema in robotics. First, we examine application-oriented research: how a robot can improve its capabilities by being able to automatically synthesize, extend, or adapt a model of its body. Second, we summarize the research area in which robots are used as tools to verify hypotheses on the mechanisms underlying biological body representations. We identify trends in these research areas and propose future research directions.

611	An Adaptive Control Strategy for DSTATCOM Applications in an Electric Ship Power System	Mitra, P.; Venayagamoorthy, G.K.	Power Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20100129	Distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is a shunt compensation device that is generally used to solve power quality problems in distribution systems. In an all-electric ship power system, power quality issues arise due to high-energy demand loads such as pulse loads. This paper presents the application of a DSTATCOM to improve the power quality in a ship power system during and after pulse loads. The control strategy of the DSTATCOM plays an important role in maintaining the voltage at the point of common coupling. A novel adaptive control strategy for the DSTATCOM based on artificial immune system (AIS) is presented in this paper. The optimal parameters of the controller are first obtained by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. This provides a sort of innate immunity (robustness) to common system disturbances. For unknown and random system disturbances, the controller parameters are modified online, thus providing adaptive immunity to the control system. The performance of the DSTATCOM and the AIS-based adaptive control strategy is first investigated in MATLAB-/Simulink-based simulation platform. It is verified through a real-time ship power system implementation on a real-time digital simulator and the control algorithm on a digital signal processor.

613	Automatic Generation of Game Level Solutions as Storyboards	Pizzi, D.; Lugrin, J.-L.; Whittaker, A.; Cavazza, M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100913	Game programmers rely on artificial intelligence techniques to encode characters' behaviors initially specified by game designers. Although significant efforts have been made to assist their collaboration, the formalization of behaviors remains a time-consuming process during the early stages of game development. We propose an authoring tool allowing game designers to formalize, visualize, modify, and validate game level solutions in the form of automatically generated storyboards. This system uses planning techniques to produce a level solution consistent with gameplay constraints. The main planning agent corresponds to the player character, and the system uses the game actions as planning operators and level objectives as goals to plan the level solutions. Generated solutions are presented as 2-D storyboards similar to comic strips. We present in this paper the first version of a fully implemented prototype as well as examples of generated storyboards, adapted from the original design documents of the blockbuster game Hitman.

617	An AI-Based Break-Scheduling System for Supervisory Personnel	Beer, A.; Gartner, J.; Musliu, N.; Schafhauser, W.; Slany, W.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20100503	Designing shift plans represents a difficult but interesting task because they must satisfy various, often conflicting, requirements. In this article, we address a complex real-world break-scheduling problem for supervisory personnel and present a scheduling system that can help professional planners create high-quality shift plans. Supervisory personnel spend most of their workday in front of computer monitors, addressing critical and constantly changing situations. For employees working under such conditions to always maintain high levels of concentration, it's essential that they take occasional breaks. Usually, the amount of break time, as well as the position and duration of breaks within their work time (shift) are regulated by labor rules that must be satisfied by a feasible shift plan. Moreover, to guarantee effective supervision, a minimum number of employees must be working at any given time.

618	Improved clustering method based on artificial immune	Zhu, Lin; Li, Bo	Systems Engineering and Electronics, Journal of	20120117	An improved clustering method based on artificial immune is proposed. To obtain the better initial solution, the initial antibody network is introduced by self organizing map (SOM) method. In the process of the clustering iteration, a series of optimization and evolution strategies are designed, such as clustering satisfaction, the threshold design of scale compression, the learning rate, the clustering monitoring points and the clustering evaluations indexes. These strategies can make the clustering thresholds be quantified and reduce the operator's subjective factors. Thus, the local optimal and the global optimal clustering simultaneously are proposed by the synthesized function of these strategies. Finally, the experiment and the comparisons demonstrate the proposed method effectiveness.	artificial immune system (AIS);clustering;self organizing map (SOM),Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Indexes;Monitoring

621	New Circuit Topology for Fault Tolerant H-Bridge DCﾖDC Converter	Ambusaidi, K.; Pickert, Volker; Zahawi, B.	Power Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20100601	This paper describes a new design for a fault tolerant H-bridge dc-dc converter. Fault tolerance is achieved using a multilevel converter topology in combination with a pulsewidth modulation control strategy allowing a large set of converter switching states to produce bidirectional power flows at any required output voltage. For a given converter open-circuit or short-circuit fault, all potential switch combinations are compared in terms of converter losses and output voltage harmonics to identify the most suitable switching combinations to achieve the prefault output voltage level. The fault tolerant ability of the proposed converter to recover the required output voltage is verified by both computer simulations and experimentally using a 1 kW laboratory set.

622	The Power of Forgetting: Improving the Last-Good-Reply Policy in Monte Carlo Go	Baier, H.; Drake, P.D.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110117	The dominant paradigm for programs playing the game of Go is Monte Carlo tree search. This algorithm builds a search tree by playing many simulated games (playouts). Each playout consists of a sequence of moves within the tree followed by many moves beyond the tree. Moves beyond the tree are generated by a biased random sampling policy. The recently published last-good-reply policy makes moves that, in previous playouts, have been successful replies to immediately preceding moves. This paper presents a modification of this policy that not only remembers moves that recently succeeded but also immediately forgets moves that recently failed. This modification provides a large improvement in playing strength. We also show that responding to the previous two moves is superior to responding to the previous one move. Surprisingly, remembering the win rate of every reply performs much worse than simply remembering the last good reply (and indeed worse than not storing good replies at all).

Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, IEEE Transactions on	20100816	An area-efficient multistage 3.0- to 8.5-GHz ultrawideband low-noise amplifier (LNA) utilizing tunable active inductors (AIs) is presented. The AI includes a negative impedance circuit (NIC) consisting of a pair of cross-coupled NMOS transistors and is tuned to vary the gain and bandwidth (BW) of the amplifier. Fabricated in a 90-nm digital CMOS process, the proposed fully on-chip LNA occupies a core chip area of only 0.022 mm2. The measurement results show a power gain S21 of 16.0 dB, a noise figure of 3.1-4.4 dB, and an input return loss S11 of less than -10.5 dB over the 3-dB BW of 3.0-8.5 GHz. Tuning the AIs allows one to increase the gain above 18.0 dB and to extend the BW over 9.4 GHz. The LNA consumes 16.0 mW from a power supply of 1.2 V.

Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on	20100920	A new discharge-based multipulse technique has been developed in this paper, which overcomes the shortcomings of the existing techniques, such as the charge pumping, charge injection and sensing, and two-pulse C-V techniques. It captures the energy signature for electron traps across high-? materials and can be a useful tool for material selection during technology development. Trap distributions in HfO2, AI2O3, and HfAlO have been compared to identify the effects of material variation. It is observed that hafnium gives the shallow traps at about 0.45 eV above the silicon conduction band bottom (Si ECB), and the deep traps at 0.8 eV below the Si ECB are caused by aluminum. HfO2 combines the features in HfO2 and AI2O3. A peak near the Si ECB has been observed in all the three materials.

626	Highly Spectrally Efficient DWDM Transmission at 7.0 b/s/Hz Using 8  65.1-Gb/s Coherent PDM-OFDM	Takahashi, H.; Al Amin, A.; Jansen, S.L.; Morita, I.; Tanaka, H.	Lightwave Technology, Journal of	20100208	In this paper, we discuss the realization of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission at high spectral efficiency. For this experiment, coherent polarization-division multiplexing--orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (PDM-OFDM) is used as a modulation format. PDM-OFDM uses training symbols for channel estimation. This makes OFDM easily scalable to higher level modulation formats as channel estimation is realized with training symbols that are independent of the constellation size. Furthermore, because of its well-defined spectrum OFDM requires only a small guard band between WDM channels. The dependence of the number of OFDM subcarriers is investigated with respect to the interchannel linear crosstalk. At a constant data rate the number of OFDM subcarriers is estimated to achieve lower linear crosstalk in order to achieve higher spectral efficiency. We then experimentally demonstrate dense WDM (DWDM) transmission with 7.0-b/s/Hz net spectral efficiency using 8 ?? 65.1-Gb/s coherent PDM-OFDM signals with 8-GHz WDM channel spacing utilizing 32-quadrature-amplitude-modulation subcarrier modulation. Successful transmission is achieved over 240 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) spans with hybrid erbium-doped fiber amplifiers/Raman amplification.

Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20091030	This paper emulates a biological notion in vaccines to promote exploration in the search space for solving multimodal function optimization problems using artificial immune systems (AISs). In this method, we first divide the decision space into equal subspaces. The vaccine is then randomly extracted from each subspace. A few of these vaccines, in the form of weakened antigens, are then injected into the algorithm to enhance the exploration of global and local optima. The goal of this process is to lead the antibodies to unexplored areas. Using this biologically motivated notion, we design the vaccine-enhanced AIS for multimodal function optimization, achieving promising performance.

An electroluminescence peak centered at 23.4 meV with a full width at half maximum of 4.2 meV is observed under a bias of 2 V at low temperature (T=4.5ﾠK). The emission peak is attributed to the 2p to 1s internal transitions of the Be acceptors in the center of ?-doped GaAs quantum well.

The LMI-based criterion heavily depends on both the upper and lower bounds on time delay and its derivative, which is different from the existent ones and has wider application fields than some present results. Finally, three numerical examples can illustrate the efficiency of the new method based on the reduced conservatism which can be achieved by thinning the delay interval.

632	Ferromagnetic metamaterial with tunable negative index of refraction	Da-yong Zou; Ai-min Jiang; Wu, Rui-xin	Journal of Applied Physics	20100112	We investigate the index of refraction of the ferromagnetic metamaterial, which consists of periodic layered ferrite and semiconductor or metallic mesh. We find that the metamaterial has the negative index; the frequency range and magnitude of the negative index are tunable in applied magnetic fields. The frequency range of the negative index shifts to higher frequencies as the applied magnetic fields increase. The permeability and permittivity of the ferrite and other component materials, as well as their thickness ratios, influence the tunable range of the negative index. It is demonstrated that ferrite-mesh structure has a much lower loss than that of a ferrite-semiconductor structure.	ferrites;ferromagnetic materials;high-frequency effects;magnetic permeability;metamaterials;permittivity;refractive index;semiconductor materials							
633	Learning to Drive in the Open Racing Car Simulator Using Online Neuroevolution	Cardamone, L.; Loiacono, D.; Lanzi, P.L.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100913	In this paper, we applied online neuroevolution to evolve nonplayer characters for The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS). While previous approaches allowed online learning with performance improvements during each generation, our approach enables a finer grained online learning with performance improvements within each lap. We tested our approach on three tracks using two methods of online neuroevolution (NEAT and rtNEAT) combined with four evaluation strategies ( -greedy, -greedy-improved, softmax, and interval-based) taken from the literature. We compared the eight resulting configurations on several driving tasks involving the learning of a driving behavior for a specific track, its adaptation to a new track, and the generalization capability to unknown tracks. The results we present show that, notwithstanding the several challenges that online learning poses, our approach 1) can successfully evolve drivers from scratch, 2) can also be used to transfer evolved knowledge to other tracks, and 3) can generalize effectively producing controllers that can drive on difficult unseen tracks. Our results also suggest that the approach performs better when coupled with online NEAT and also indicate that -greedy-improved and softmax are generally better than the other evaluation strategies. A comparison with typical offline neuroevolution suggests that online neuroevolution can be competitive and even outperform traditional offline approaches on more difficult tracks while providing all the interesting features of online learning. Overall, we believe that this study may represent an initial step toward the application of online neuroevolution in games.

634	Game Bot Detection via Avatar Trajectory Analysis	Hsing-Kuo Pao; Kuan-Ta Chen; Hong-Chung Chang	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100913	The objective of this work is to automatically detect the use of game bots in online games based on the trajectories of account users. Online gaming has become one of the most popular Internet activities in recent years, but cheating activity, such as the use of game bots, has increased as a consequence. Generally, the gaming community disapproves of the use of bots, as users may obtain unreasonable rewards without making corresponding efforts. However, game bots are hard to detect because they are designed to simulate human game playing behavior and they follow game rules exactly. Existing methods cannot solve the problem as the differences between bot and human trajectories are generally hard to describe. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting game bots based on some dissimilarity measurements between the trajectories of either bots or human users. The measurements are combined with manifold learning and classification techniques for detection; and the approach is generalizable to any game in which avatars' movements are controlled by the players directly. Through real-life data traces, we observe that the trajectories of bots and humans are very different. Since certain human behavior patterns are difficult to mimic, the characteristic can be used as a signature for bot detection. To evaluate the proposed scheme's performance, we conduct a case study of a popular online game called Quake 2. The results show that the scheme can achieve a high detection rate or classification accuracy on a short trace of several hundred seconds.

635	The Design of Puzzle Selection Strategies for ESP-Like GWAP Systems	Ling-Jyh Chen; Bo-Chun Wang; Wen-Yuan Zhu	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100614	The ﾓgames with a purposeﾔ (GWAP) genre is a type of ﾓhuman computationﾔ that outsources certain steps of the computational process to humans. Although most GWAP studies focus on the design and analysis of GWAP systems, a systematic and thorough evaluation of existing systems is lacking. We address the issue in this paper. Taking the ESP game as an example, we propose a metric, called system utility, for evaluating the performance of GWAP systems, and use analysis to study the properties of the ESP game. We argue that GWAP systems should be designed and played with strategies. To this end, based on our analysis, we implement an optimal puzzle selection strategy (OPSA) to improve GWAP systems. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we show that the proposed OPSA approach can improve the system utility of the ESP game significantly. In addition, we implement a quasi ESP game, called ESP Lite, which embeds three puzzle selection algorithms transparently and records the complete game trace for evaluation and further research. During a one-month experiment, we have investigated the inner properties of the three strategies in real-world GWAP systems, and verified that the OPSA scheme achieves the best system utility for the ESP game. The results of this study demonstrate that GWAP systems are more efficient if they are designed and played with strategies.

636	Potential contrast improvement in ultrasound pulse inversion imaging using EMD and EEMD	Ai-Ho Liao; Che-Chou Shen; Pai-Chi Li	Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, IEEE Transactions on	20100218	Ultrasound nonlinear imaging using microbubble- based contrast agents has been widely investigated. Nonetheless, its contrast is often reduced by the nonlinearity of acoustic wave propagation in tissue. In this paper, we explore the use of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) in the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) for possible contrast improvement. The HHT is designed for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary data, whereas EMD is a method associated with the HHT that allows decomposition of data into a finite number of intrinsic modes. The hypothesis is that the nonlinear signal from microbubbles and the tissue nonlinear signal can be better differentiated with EMD and EEMD, thus making contrast improvement possible. Specifically, we tested this method on pulse-inversion nonlinear imaging, which is generally regarded as one of the most effective nonlinear imaging methods. The results show that the contrast-to-tissue ratios at the fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies were improved by 10.2 and 4.3 dB, respectively, after EEMD. Nonetheless, image artifacts also appeared, and hence further investigation is needed before EMD and EEMD can be applied in practical applications of ultrasound nonlinear imaging.	,Acoustic imaging;Acoustic propagation;Acoustic waves;Frequency;Pulse inverters;Testing;Ultrasonic imaging,Hilbert transforms;acoustic signal processing;biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;bubbles;harmonics;nonlinear acousticsEEMD;EMD;Hilbert-Huang transform;acoustic wave propagation;contrast agents;contrast-to-tissue ratios;empirical mode decomposition;ensemble empirical mode decomposition;fundamental frequency;image artifacts;microbubbles;second-harmonic frequency;ultrasound nonlinear imaging;ultrasound pulse inversion imagingAlgorithms;Computer Simulation;Contrast Media;Microbubbles;Nonlinear Dynamics;Phantoms, Imaging;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography							
637	Modeling Player Experience for Content Creation	Pedersen, C.; Togelius, J.; Yannakakis, G.N.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100311	In this paper, we use computational intelligence techniques to built quantitative models of player experience for a platform game. The models accurately predict certain key affective states of the player based on both gameplay metrics that relate to the actions performed by the player in the game, and on parameters of the level that was played. For the experiments presented here, a version of the classic Super Mario Bros game is enhanced with parameterizable level generation and gameplay metrics collection. Player pairwise preference data is collected using forced choice questionnaires, and the models are trained using this data and neuroevolutionary preference learning of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The derived models will be used to optimize design parameters for particular types of player experience, allowing the designer to automatically generate unique levels that induce the desired experience for the player.

639	Local Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks	Ai Chen; Kumar, S.; Lai, T.H.	Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20100225	Global barrier coverage, which requires much fewer sensors than full coverage, is known to be an appropriate model of coverage for movement detection applications such as intrusion detection. However, it has been proved that given a sensor deployment, sensors can not locally determine whether the deployment provides global barrier coverage, making it impossible to develop localized algorithms, thus limiting its use in practice. In this paper, we introduce the concept of local barrier coverage to address this limitation. Motivated by the observation that movements are likely to follow a shorter path in crossing a belt region, local barrier coverage guarantees the detection of all movements whose trajectory is confined to a slice of the belt region of deployment. We prove that it is possible for individual sensors to locally determine the existence of local barrier coverage, even when the region of deployment is arbitrarily curved. Although local barrier coverage does not deterministically guarantee global barrier coverage, we show that for thin belt regions, local barrier coverage almost always provides global barrier coverage. To demonstrate that local barrier coverage can be used to design localized algorithms, we develop a novel sleep-wakeup algorithm for maximizing the network lifetime, called localized barrier coverage protocol (LBCP). We prove that LBCP guarantees local barrier coverage and show that LBCP provides close to optimal enhancement in the network lifetime, while providing global barrier coverage most of the time. They outperform an existing algorithm called randomized independent sleeping (RIS) by up to six times.

Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20100819	High-frequency surface-wave (HFSW) radars are usually used to remotely measure oceanographic parameters. These systems can also potentially detect targets beyond the conventional microwave radar coverage. In this paper, the backscattered Doppler spectrum made up of the sea clutter, ship echoes, and the background noise has been modeled. Taking into account the propagation and the signal-processing effects, a range-Doppler image has been generated. This model can be used for different purposes like the (theoretical) evaluation of detection performance. This paper gives an overview of the theoretical elements for modeling the backscatter signal. The processing effects on the range-Doppler image and the time-evolving target signature are also introduced. Some of the simulated elements and the obtained range-Doppler images are compared with real data. Finally, from this model, the detection capabilities of HFSW radars are evaluated.

643	RL-DOT: A Reinforcement Learning NPC Team for Playing Domination Games	Hao Wang; Yang Gao; Xingguo Chen	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100311	In this paper, we describe the design of reinforcement-learning-based domination team (RL-DOT), a nonplayer character (NPC) team for playing Unreal Tournament (UT) Domination games. In RL-DOT, there is a commander NPC and several soldier NPCs. The running process of RL-DOT consists of several decision cycles. In each decision cycle, the commander NPC makes a decision of troop distribution and, according to that decision, sends action orders to other soldier NPCs. Each soldier NPC tries to accomplish its task in a goal-directed way, i.e., decomposing the final ultimate task (attacking or defending a domination point) into basic actions (such as running and shooting) that are directly supported by UT application programming interfaces (APIs). We use a Q-learning-style algorithm to learn the optimal decision-making policy. We carefully choose some opponent policies for our illustrative experiments. In these experiments, RL-DOT shows a distinct learning characteristic, which illustrates its efficiency in playing UT Domination games.

644	Improved adaptive interpolation filter for H.264/AVC	Wei, Yuping; Ji, Xiangyang; Zhang, Naiyao; Dai, Qionghai	Tsinghua Science and Technology	20120117	Motion compensation with adaptive interpolation filters (AIF) was developed to compensate for temporary varieties in the aliasing of video signals and improve the coding efficiency. The AI F achieves better RD performance than common static interpolation filtering by exploiting the statistics in the reference frames' local auto-correlation and the local cross-correlation between the current encoding frame and the reference frames. This paper presents an interpolation filter buffering structure that derives the current encoding frame's interpolation filters from the filters of previous frames. The number of encoding bits for the filter coefficients is reduced by encoding only the differences between the current filter coefficients and the corresponding buffered filter coefficients. Experimental results show that in comparison with the AI F in the current ﾓkey technical areaﾔ (KTA) reference software, this interpolation filter buffering structure further improves all the test sequences (with up to 2.87%bit rate saving) with negligible computational increase.	adaptive interpolation filter;motion compensation;video coding,Encoding;Filtering algorithms;Information filters;Interpolation;Streaming media;Video coding							
645	Hybrid anti-prematuration optimization algorithm	Wang, Qiaoling; Gao, Xiaozhi; Wang, Changhong; Liu, Furong	Systems Engineering and Electronics, Journal of	20120117	Heuristic optimization methods provide a robust and efficient approach to solving complex optimization problems. This paper presents a hybrid optimization technique combining two heuristic optimization methods, artificial immune system (AIS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), together in searching for the global optima of nonlinear functions. The proposed algorithm, namely hybrid anti-prematuration optimization method, contains four significant operators, i.e. swarm operator, cloning operator, suppression operator, and receptor editing operator. The swarm operator is inspired by the particle swarm intelligence, and the clone operator, suppression operator, and receptor editing operator are gleaned by the artificial immune system. The simulation results of three representative nonlinear test functions demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid optimization algorithm over the conventional methods with regard to both the solution quality and convergence rate. It is also employed to cope with a real-world optimization problem.	anti-prematu ration;artificial immune sys-tem (AIS);clonal selection;hybrid optimization algorithm;particle swarm optimization (PSO),Cloning;Convergence;Immune system;Optimization methods;Particle swarm optimization

Applied Physics Letters	20100916	We report on the development of elliptical, index tailored optical fibers for higher-order mode preservation for fiber-based, apertureless, internally illuminated scanning near-field optical microscopy (ai-SNOM). The fiber structure is simulated by the finite element method, showing large spreads of the effective indices for neighboring first higher-order modes. We demonstrate experimentally that due to this spread, the first higher-order modes do not couple, hence, the polarization is maintained, when the fiber is bent down to 1 cm radius. Further, we discuss the implications for ai-SNOM applications.	finite element analysis;near-field scanning optical microscopy;optical fibre polarisation0270Dh;0779Fc;4281Gs,

High-speed electrical measurements with temporal resolution in the nanosecond range were employed to measure the flashover characteristics, and high-speed three-frame photography was used to image the flashover channels at different phases along the insulator surface. From these test results, the flashover under nanosecond pulse would experience a process with three typical phases: initial phase, developing phase, and extinguishing phase.

655	An EWMA Algorithm With a Cycled Resetting (CR) Discount Factor for Drift and Fault of High-Mix Run-to-Run Control	Ying Zheng; Bing Ai; Wong, D.S.-H.; Shi-Shang Jang; Yanwei Wang; Jie Zhang	Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on	20100503	Run-to-run controllers based on the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) statistic are probably the most frequently used for the quality control of certain semiconductor manufacturing process steps. The threaded-EWMA run-to-run control is an important stable control scheme. However, the process outputs will deviate largely in the first few runs of each cycle if the disturbance follows an IMA(1,1) series with deterministic linear drift and the thread has a long break length. In this paper, the output of the threaded-EWMA run-to-run control is derived, stability conditions are given, and the causes of large deviations in the first few runs of each cycle are found. Based on the analysis of system performance, a cycled resetting (CR) algorithm for discount factor is proposed to reduce the large deviations, as well as to achieve the minimum asymptotic variance control. Furthermore, how to deal with step fault is also discussed in this paper. By analyzing the influence of the fault, a discount factor resetting fault-tolerant (RFT) approach is proposed. Simulation study shows both the mean square error (MSE) and variance of the output by the proposed algorithm is about 30% to 50% lower than that of the algorithm with fixed discount factor in the process with and without oscillation. This verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100614	Players of real-time strategy (RTS) games are often annoyed by the inability of the game AI to select and move teams of units in a natural way. Units travel and battle separately, resulting in huge losses and the AI looking unintelligent, as can the choice of units sent to counteract the opponents. Players are affected as well as computer commanded factions because they cannot micromanage all team related issues. We suggest improving AI behavior by combining well-known computational intelligence techniques applied in an original way. Team composition for battling spatially distributed opponent groups is supported by a learning self-organizing map (SOM) that relies on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to adapt it to the game. Different abilities of unit types are thus employed in a near-optimal way, reminiscent of human ad hoc decisions. Team movement is greatly enhanced by flocking and influence map-based path finding, leading to a more natural behavior by preserving individual motion types. The team decision to either attack or avoid a group of enemy units is easily parametrizable, incorporating team characteristics from fearful to daredevil. We demonstrate that these two approaches work well separately, but also that they go together naturally, thereby leading to an improved and flexible group behavior.

Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures	20101203	Using high-resolution electron-beam lithography and lift-off, Au structures with sub-10 nm dimensions or spacings were fabricated on 30-nm-thick silicon-nitride (SiN) membranes. Fabricating metal nanostructures on electron-transparent SiN membranes permitted their surface plasmon resonances to be measured using electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The surface plasmons that were excited by the 300 keV electron beam exhibited spatially and spectrally distinct longitudinal and transverse modes in elongated Au nanostructures. As the plasmonic response of the nanoparticle was dependent on the point of excitation of the STEM beam, a surface plasmon map could be obtained with nanometer resolution for nanostructures with various geometries. This combination of high-resolution lithography and microscopy will facilitate the design and systematic study of plasmonic nanostructures.	electron beam lithography;electron energy loss spectra;elongation;gold;nanofabrication;nanopatterning;nanostructured materials;scanning-transmission electron microscopy;surface plasmon resonance7322Lp;8116Rf,

663	Computation of Transient Electromagnetic Fields Due to Switching in High-Voltage Substations	Musa, B.U.; Wah Hoon Siew; Judd, M.D.	Power Delivery, IEEE Transactions on	20100322	Switching operations of circuit breakers and disconnect switches radiate transient electromagnetic fields within high-voltage substations. The generated fields may interfere and disrupt normal operations of electronic equipment. Hence, the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of this electronic equipment has to be considered as early as the design stage of substation planning and operation. Also, microelectronics are being introduced into the substation environment and are located close to the switching devices in the switchyards more than ever before, often referred to as distributed electronics. Hence, there is the need to re-evaluate the substation environment for EMC assessment, accounting for these issues.

664	Evaluation of Game Tree Search Methods by Game Records	Takeuchi, S.; Kaneko, T.; Yamaguchi, K.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110117	This paper presents a method of evaluating game tree search methods including standard min-max search with heuristic evaluation functions and Monte Carlo tree search, which recently achieved drastic improvements in the strength of Computer Go programs. The basic idea of this paper is to use an averaged win probability of positions having similar evaluation values. Accuracy measures of evaluation values with respect to win probabilities can be used to assess the performance of game tree search methods. A plot of win probabilities against evaluation values should have consistency and monotonicity if the evaluation values are produced by a good game tree search method. By inspecting whether the plot has the properties for some subset of positions, we can detect specific deficiencies in the game tree search method. We applied our method to Go, Shogi, and Chess, and by comparing the results with empirical understanding of the performance of various game tree search methods and with the results of self-plays, we show that our method is efficient and effective.

665	Stability Analysis and Control of Nonlinear Phenomena in Boost Converters Using Model-Based TakagiﾖSugeno Fuzzy Approach	Mehran, K.; Giaouris, D.; Zahawi, B.	Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, IEEE Transactions on	20100202	The application of a novel Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy-model-based approach to prohibit the onset of subharmonic instabilities in dc-dc power electronic converters is presented in this paper. The use of a model-based fuzzy approach derived from an average mathematical model to control the nonlinearities in power electronic converters has been reported in the literature, but this is known to act as a low-pass filter, thus ignoring all nonlinear phenomena occurring at converter clock frequency. This paper shows how converter fast-scale instabilities can be captured by extending the TS fuzzy modeling concept to nonsmooth dynamical systems by combining the TS fuzzy modeling technique with nonsmooth Lyapunov stability theory. The new method is applied to the current-mode-controlled boost converter to demonstrate how the stability analysis can be directly applied by formularizing the stability conditions as a numerical problem using linear matrix inequalities. Based on this methodology, a new type of switching fuzzy controller is proposed. The resulting control scheme is able to maintain the stable period-one behavior of the converter over a wide range of operating conditions while improving the transient response of the circuit.

666	Magnetization configurations and reversal of thin magnetic nanotubes with uniaxial anisotropy	Chen, A.P.; Guslienko, K.Y.; Gonzalez, J.	Journal of Applied Physics	20101104	We present calculations of the magnetization configuration and reversal behavior of magnetic nanotubes with uniaxial anisotropy by means of two-dimensional micromagnetic simulations and analytical methods. The tube radii R from 50 to 150 nm and the tube length /radius aspect ratio L/R?20 were explored. For a finite length of magnetic nanotubes the magnetization configuration is characterized by a uniformly magnetized along the tube axis middle part and two nonuniform curling states of a length Lc in two ends of the tube with the same or opposite magnetization rotating senses, referring as C-state or B-state, respectively. We found that the magnetization configuration of the C-state exists for thin nanotubes with the tube thickness, ?R, in the range of ?R/R?0.2. For thicker nanotubes the strong magnetostatic stray field forces the change of rotating senses of the end domains in opposite directions (the B-state). The transition from the C-state to a vortex state with in-plane magnetization is described as function of the tube geometrical parameters. The nanotube hysteresis loops and switching fields were calculated. The simple analytical model was developed to describe the nanotube magnetization reversal reducing its description to the StonerﾖWohlfarth model with effective parameters. The equilibrium state of nanotube is described in terms of ?, the angle of the magnetization deviation from the intrinsic tube easy axis. The L/R dependence of the C-state magnetization, the shape of hysteresis loops and the switching field values are described by a dependence of ? on L/R.	magnetic anisotropy;magnetic hysteresis;magnetic switching;magnetisation reversal;micromagnetics;nanomagnetics;nanotubes7530Gw;7560Ej;7560Jk;7575-c;7578Cd;7578Jp,

This leads to a significant increase in particle yield over a pre-existing technique which utilizes a 1ﾠcm2 stamp patterned using e-beam lithography. Changes in nanopillar dimensions from the self-assembled stamps and variations in the associated processing conditions can lead to the fabrication of particles with different dimensions. We demonstrate that it is possible to produce reasonably uniformly sized SAFs with diameters from 70 nm upward using self-assembled stamps. The particles exhibit low remanence at low externally applied magnetic fields, and that the saturation magnetization more than double that for conventional iron oxide nanoparticles.	antiferromagnetic materials;cobalt alloys;electron beam lithography;iron alloys;magnetic multilayers;magnetic particles;nanolithography;nanoparticles;remanence;ruthenium;self-assembly;sputter etching;tantalum6146Df;7560Ej;7570Cn;7575-c;8116Dn;8116Nd,

The fiber laser is passively mode locked by using nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) technique. The polarization-dependent isolator combined with the intracavity birefringence acts as two functions: the tunable comb filter and the mode locker. Up to four-wavelength picosecond pulses were simultaneously obtained in the experiment. The mode competition of the multiwavelength lasing is suppressed by the use of NPR-induced intensity-dependent loss. In addition, the number of the lasing wavelengths, the lasing location, and the spacing between the lasing wavelengths could be flexibly tuned by properly rotating the polarization controllers.

We compare nested Monte Carlo (NMC) search, upper confidence bounds for trees (UCT-T), UCT with transposition tables (UCT+T), and a simple combination of NMC and UCT+T (MAX) on single-player games of the past General Game Playing (GGP) competitions. We show that transposition tables improve UCT and that MAX is the best of these four algorithms. Using UCT+T, the program Ary won the 2009 GGP competition.

Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20100726	Wireless sensor networks can be used for event warning applications. Till date, in most of the proposed schemes, the raw or aggregated sensed data are periodically sent to a data consuming center. However, with those schemes, the occurrence of an emergency event such as a fire is hardly reported timely, which is a strict requirement for event warning applications. In wireless sensor networks, it is also highly desired to conserve energy so that network lifetime can be maximized. Furthermore, to ensure the quality of surveillance, some applications require that if an event occurs, it needs to be detected by at least k sensors, where k is a user-defined parameter. In this work, we examine the Timely Energy-efficient k-Watching Event Monitoring (TEKWEM) problem and propose a scheme, which involves an event detection model and a warning delivery model, for monitoring composite events and delivering warnings to users. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are shown to validate the proposed scheme.

Considering the ship target's gray intensity distribution and its shape difference compared to the clutter, in this letter, a new algorithm is presented based on correlation. The algorithm utilizes the strong gray intensity correlation in the ship target; also, the joint gray intensity distribution using 2-D joint log-normal distribution of a pixel with neighboring pixels in the clutter is modeled, which can be used for correlation-based joint constant false alarm rate detection. Using this algorithm, the false alarms caused by speckle and local background nonhomogeneity can be greatly reduced.

Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20100603	This paper studies the problem of admission control and air interface (AI) selection in heterogeneous network environments. The statistics of random user arrivals, channel conditions and service durations are considered for the optimization of heterogeneous access management strategies with respect to minimizing the expected mean cost for blocking events. Based on state aggregation in a semi-Markov decision process formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm using state aggregation for policy optimization is proposed. Though this solution is suboptimal, it still offers considerable performance gains in comparison to simpler heuristic strategies, which is demonstrated by simulations in a heterogeneous GSM-EDGE (Global System for Mobile Communications Enhanced Data Rate)/UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) scenario. Furthermore, structural properties of optimal user assignment policies are studied, proving certain monotonicity properties for a specific type of systems.

687	Adaptive channel allocation for enabling target SINR achievability in power-controlled wireless networks	Kucera, S.; Aissa, S.; Yoshida, S.	Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20100205	This paper offers a new insight to the fundamental problem of efficient admission control in arbitrary power-controlled wireless networks with an unknown call arrival distribution. Active transmitter-receiver pairs are assumed to (i) communicate simultaneously over shared channels, (ii) define target signal-to-interference and noise ratios (SINRs) by nonlinear functions of channel interference, and (iii) use adaptive power control to maintain the actual SINR at the target level in response to interference variations. Unlike other studies, in this study, power control with limited dynamic range and both the discrete-time and the continuous-time dynamics is explicitly considered, as well as the effects of stochastic radio propagation phenomena. Without relying on a priori assumptions, we first define sufficient conditions for a channel allocation mechanism to ensure the SINR constraints in cooperation with the deployed power control mechanism. We use the concept of Lyapunov stability as a cross-layer optimization criterion. Subsequently, we focus on the widely assumed case of SINR targets being defined by linear functions of interference, and show that such targets can be achieved if hii > |Ai|¿ j¿i hij ¿i, where hij is the channel gain between the transmitter of link j and the receiver of link i, and Ai is the slope of the linear definition of the target SINR. This knowledge allows us to propose a simple distributed algorithm for implementing an admission control mechanism that (i) uses interference and pilot signal measurements as its only decision-making input, and (ii) allows links to adaptively adjust the SINR targets within the system stability bounds. This mechanism is shown to outperform the carrier sensing approach (CSMA/CA) for admission control.

The nonlinear observer generates the position estimate ???? via the estimates of sin ?? and cos ??. In contrast to Luenberger-type observers, it does not require speed information, thus eliminating the complexity associated with speed estimation errors. Further, it is simple to implement. In this study, the nonlinear observer performance is verified experimentally. To obtain speed estimates from the position information, a proportional-integral (PI) tracking controller speed estimator was utilized. The results are good with and without loads, above 10 r/min.

699	Using Resource-Limited Nash Memory to Improve an Othello Evaluation Function	Manning, E.P.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100311	Finding the best strategy for winning a game using self-play or coevolution can be hindered by intransitivity among strategies and a changing fitness landscape. Nash Memory has been proposed as an archive for coevolution, to counter intransitivity and provide a more consistent fitness landscape. A lack of bounds on archive size might impede its use in a large, complex domain, such as the game of Othello, with strategies described by n -tuple networks. This paper demonstrates that even with a bounded-size archive, an evolving population can continue to show progress past the point where self-play no longer can. Characteristics of Nash equilibria are shown to be valuable in the measurement of performance. In addition, a technique for automated selection of features is demonstrated for the n-tuple networks.

700	On Computational Humor	Taylor, J.M.; Mazlack, L.J.	Potentials, IEEE	20101104	Humor is everywhere, as long as you are willing to see it, both accidental and intentional. Computers have evolved from simple calculating machines to playing chess, controlling air and space flights, and talking to humans. They are increasingly used to informally gather information from humans using human language. The paper mentions that will a computer ever understand humor as well as we do? Some people believe that humor is artificial intelligence-complete. In other words, humor is one of the most difficult problems in AI.	,Computers;Dictionaries;Distance measurement;Humans;Natural languages;Ontologies;Semantics,artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence;computational humor;human language							
701	Monte Carlo Tree Search in Hex	Arneson, B.; Hayward, R.B.; Henderson, P.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110117	Hex, the classic board game invented by Piet Hein in 1942 and independently by John Nash in 1948, has been a domain of AI research since Claude Shannon's seminal work in the 1950s. Until the Monte Carlo Go revolution a few years ago, the best computer Hex players used knowledge-intensive alpha-beta search. Since that time, strong Monte Carlo Hex players have appeared that are on par with the best alpha-beta Hex players. In this paper, we describe MoHex, the Monte Carlo tree search Hex player that won gold at the 2009 Computer Olympiad. Our main contributions to Monte Carlo tree search include using inferior cell analysis and connection strategy computation to prune the search tree. In particular, we run our random game simulations not on the actual game position, but on a reduced equivalent board.

705	Alteration of Ambient GABA by Phasic and Tonic Neuronal Activation	Hoshino, O	Neural Computation	20140519	Neurons of primary auditory cortex (AI) emit spikes (action potentials) in two distinct manners, responding to sounds in an onset or a sustained manner. The former AI neurons are called phasic cells and the latter tonic cells. The phasic cells generate spikes for a brief time period (less than hundreds of milliseconds) at the onset of an auditory stimulus (e.g., a tone frequency sound), and the tonic cells continuously generate spikes throughout the stimulation period. Simulating a neural network model of AI, we investigated whether and how the onset discharges influence the sustained discharges that are believed to play a central role in encoding auditory information. Onset discharges, triggered by a phasic input, briefly excited GABAergic interneurons and transiently increased the level of ambient GABA, which was immediately recognized by extrasynaptic GABAa receptors and provided inhibitory currents into neurons. The transient alteration of ambient GABA allowed tonic cells to respond selectively to a tonic input. The timing of phasic input relative to a tonic one had a great impact on the responsiveness of tonic cells. We found optimal timing for the best selective responsiveness: phasic input preceding tonic input by several tens of milliseconds. Offset discharges induced by a secondary input to phasic cells, applied at the end of the tonic input period, suddenly terminated the sustained discharges and allowed the network to return rapidly to the ongoing-spontaneous neuronal state. We suggest that the transporter-mediated alteration of ambient GABA, triggered by onset discharges, may improve the response property of AI neurons. Offset discharges may have a role in resetting AI neurons so that they can prepare for the next auditory input.								
706	Old Verse, New Idea: Why Artificial Is Real	Wang, Fei-Yue	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20100930	Welcome to our AI Space Odyssey! Of course, this issue is not an adventurous voyage in physical space, but rather a great intellectual quest: a discovery of AI in Space. Also, a reinterpretation of an ancient Chinese verse by Zhang Zai reveals a new idea in forming a computational theory to conduct the modeling, analysis, control, and management of complex systems in a quantitative fashion. It seems that artificial is real and vice versa, at least in complex systems. Future issues may discuss AI in cyberspace, where real human intelligence is alien, while AI the native intelligence.

The sequentially rotated series-parallel stub technique is employed in constructing the feed network to allow symmetrical positioning of microstrip patch elements, resulting in good axial ratio of polarization. In addition, an L-shaped matching branch is used to offer good impedance matching and spatial flexibility for positioning patch elements. Both simulation and measurement results are presented. They agree with each other well and demonstrate much better 3-dB axial-ratio bandwidth and return loss than the single patch antenna.

708	Cinematic Visual Discourse: Representation, Generation, and Evaluation	Jhala, A.; Young, R.M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100614	In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an end-to-end camera planning system called Darshak. Darshak automatically constructs cinematic narrative discourse of a given story in a 3-D virtual environment. It utilizes a hierarchical partial-order causal link (POCL) planning algorithm to generate narrative plans that contain story events and camera directives for filming them. Dramatic situation patterns, commonly used by writers of fictional narratives, are formalized as communicative plan operators that provide a basis for structuring the cinematic content of the story's visualization. The dramatic patterns are realized through abstract communicative operators that represent operations on a viewer's beliefs about the story and its telling. Camera shot compositions and transitions are defined in this plan-based framework as execution primitives. Darshak's performance is evaluated through a novel user study based on techniques used to evaluate existing cognitive models of narrative comprehension. Initial study reveals significant effect of the choice of visualization strategies on measured viewer comprehension. It further shows significant effect of Darshak's choice of visualization strategy on comprehension.

The spacing and width of these oscillations were found to be inconsistent with pure FabryﾖPerot-type interferences, but are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions that attribute them to resonant tunneling through quasibound impurity states. This observation may be understood as another signature of Klein tunneling in graphene heterojunctions and is of importance for future development and modeling of graphene based nanoelectronic devices.	bound states;field effect transistors;graphene;impurity states;resonant tunnelling;semiconductor heterojunctions8530Tv,

The proposed strategy calculates the threshold by multiplying the minimum value of the averaged squared magnitude with a predefined scaling factor. An analytical framework for choosing the scaling factor is developed based on the principle of constant false-alarm rate (CFAR). Numerical results indicate that the new strategy outperforms existing ones in a wide range of partial-band jamming scenarios.

713	Bye-Bye Agents? Not	Castelfranchi, C.	Internet Computing, IEEE	20100311	"Is Carl Hewitt a good prophet in predicting a ""Perfect Disruption: Causing the Paradigm Shift from Mental Agents to ORGs?"" The author states that the agents paradigm isn't a crisis yet and could play a more aggressive role not only in AI but in several sciences. He disagree that organizations of restricted generality (ORGs) are really an alternative to agents because they conceptually and computationally presuppose agents. In this paper, the author propose that the agent community should create a new initiative to define the various forms of agent technologies. It should be as inclusive as possible, but unless some technologies are excluded, nothing will have been defined. There should be a broad definition that represents the technologies that are included, and it should have some scientific value. People don't want to be in the business of defining ""planet"" or ""agent."" People do have to be in the business of better defining what it is we do, how it's different, and showing that it matters. Unless we do a better job of defining our scientific contributions, agents will unfortunately continue to be sidelined as a legitimate scientific endeavor and community."

714	Progress Through Uncertainty in Some Kriegspiel Endings	Bolognesi, A.; Ciancarini, P.; Favini, G.P.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100614	Kriegspiel is a wargame based on the rules of Chess. In fact, the only difference between Kriegspiel and Chess is that each player does not know his opponent's moves: the two players use different boards. A player only knows the position of his own pieces, while his opponent's pieces are invisible. A referee maintains the full state of the game on a third board. He answers a player's move attempt with information on its outcome, such as checks or piece captures. The referee also rejects illegal moves, forcing the player to try again. In this case, the player can exploit the negative information he received from the referee. As Kriegspiel has a very large state space and highly dynamic uncertainty, it is a very hard game for computers to play. In this paper, we focus on the simpler, but still difficult, task of playing the endgame. While manual algorithms have been developed to checkmate the lone King in various scenarios, they are often hard to translate into code, partially or ambiguously defined, and quite inefficient in the number of moves to mate. We describe a search algorithm for exploring the Kriegspiel endgames, and provide relatively simple evaluation functions able to progress through uncertainty. We show that our algorithm achieves quick checkmate in the vast majority of situations and significantly outperforms existing manual methods.

716	Analytical Study of Grid-Fault Response of Wind Turbine Doubly Fed Induction Generator	Pannell, G.; Atkinson, D.J.; Zahawi, B.	Energy Conversion, IEEE Transactions on	20101118	Grid-connected wind turbine doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are sensitive to dips in supply voltage, so-called ﾓgrid faultsﾔ. Fault ride through systems must be designed to manage the large and potentially dangerous fault currents in both stator and rotor circuits. However, DFIG fault response has been only partially or summarily treated in contemporary literature. This paper presents a detailed analytical analysis of wind turbine DFIG grid-fault response. The physical behavior of the machine is presented through a description of the flux-linkage response and later developed with analytical solutions of the generalized DFIG machine equations operating under fault conditions showing that the frequencies of the decay components of current deviate from pure dc and rotor speed due to magnetic drag effects. The analysis is experimentally verified and evaluated using a 7.5-kW test facility.

717	Model Reduction by Moment Matching for Linear and Nonlinear Systems	Astolfi, A.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20100930	The model reduction problem for (single-input, single-output) linear and nonlinear systems is addressed using the notion of moment. A re-visitation of the linear theory allows to obtain novel results for linear systems and to develop a nonlinear enhancement of the notion of moment. This, in turn, is used to pose and solve the model reduction problem by moment matching for nonlinear systems, to develop a notion of frequency response for nonlinear systems, and to solve model reduction problems in the presence of constraints on the reduced model. Connections between the proposed results, projection methods, the covariance extension problem and interpolation theory are presented. Finally, the theory is illustrated by means of simple worked out examples and case studies.

718	Distributed security for multi-agent systems - review and applications	Rashvand, H.F.; Salah, K.; Calero, J.M.A.; Harn, L.	Information Security, IET	20101220	As two major communication technologies, the internet and wireless, are maturing rapidly to dominate our civilised life, the authors urgently need to re-establish users' confidence to harvest new potential applications of large-scale distributed systems. Service agents and distributed multi-agent systems (MASs) have shown the potential to help with this move as the lack of trust caused by heavily compromised security issues and concerns coupled with the out-of-date solutions are hindering the progress. The authors therefore seek new remedies to ensure that the continuity in developing new economies is maintained through building new solutions to address today's techno-economical problems. Following a scan of the literature the authors discuss the state-of-the-art progress followed by some observations and remarks for the researchers in the field. Here the authors recognise the need for new 'distributed security' solutions, as an overlay service, to rejuvenate and exploit the distributed artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for secure MAS as a natural solution to pave the way to enable a long awaited application paradigm of the near future.	distributed processing;large-scale systems;multi-agent systems;security of dataInternet;MAS;distributed artificial intelligence;distributed multiagent systems;distributed security;large scale distributed systems;service agents;techno-economical problems

723	Decoding Poisson Spike Trains by Gaussian Filtering	Lehky, S	Neural Computation	20140519	The temporal waveform of neural activity is commonly estimated by low-pass filtering spike train data through convolution with a gaussian kernel. However, the criteria for selecting the gaussian width ? are not well understood. Given an ensemble of Poisson spike trains generated by an instantaneous firing rate function ?(t), the problem was to recover an optimal estimate of ?(t) by gaussian filtering. We provide equations describing the optimal value of ? using an error minimization criterion and examine how the optimal ? varies within a parameter space defining the statistics of inhomogeneous Poisson spike trains. The process was studied both analytically and through simulations. The rate functions ?(t) were randomly generated, with the three parameters defining spike statistics being the mean of ?(t), the variance of ?(t), and the exponent ? of the Fourier amplitude spectrum 1/f? of ?(t). The value of ?opt followed a power law as a function of the pooled mean interspike interval I, ?opt = aIb, where a was inversely related to the coefficient of variation CV of ?(t), and b was inversely related to the Fourier spectrum exponent ?. Besides applications for data analysis, optimal recovery of an analog signal waveform ?(t) from spike trains may also be - seful in understanding neural signal processing in vivo.

Applied Physics Letters	20100510	Carrier mobilities of the semiconducting single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been studied by using the first-principles calculations with the deformation potential approximation, which only considers the scattering by the longitudinal acoustic phonons based on the adapting BardeenﾖShockley theory [J.

From the band structures of the semiconducting SWCNTs, we calculated the effective masses, the stretching modulus, the deformation potential constants. We demonstrated that the calculated intrinsic carrier mobility can reach 106ﾠcm2/V s at room temperature, and the carrier mobilities of the semiconducting SWCNTs show the intriguing alternating behavior.	ab initio calculations;band structure;carbon nanotubes;carrier mobility;deformation;effective mass;phonons;semiconductor nanotubes6322Gh;7118+y;7220Fr;7321-b;7363Fg;8140Lm,							
725	Minimum-Threshold Crowbar for a Fault-Ride-Through Grid-Code-Compliant DFIG Wind Turbine	Pannell, G.; Atkinson, D.J.; Zahawi, B.	Energy Conversion, IEEE Transactions on	20100819	Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) technology is the dominant technology in the growing global market for wind power generation, due to the combination of variable-speed operation and a cost-effective partially rated power converter. However, the DFIG is sensitive to dips in supply voltage and without specific protection to ﾓride-throughﾔ grid faults, a DFIG risks damage to its power converter due to overcurrent and/or overvoltage. Conventional converter protection via a sustained period of rotor-crowbar closed circuit leads to poor power output and sustained suppression of the stator voltages. A new minimum-threshold rotor-crowbar method is presented in this paper, improving fault response by reducing crowbar application periods to 11-16 ms, successfully diverting transient overcurrents, and restoring good power control within 45 ms of both fault initiation and clearance, thus enabling the DFIG to meet grid-code fault-ride-through requirements. The new method is experimentally verified and evaluated using a 7.5-kW test facility.

726	Noise Isolation in Mixed-Signal Systems Using Alternating Impedance Electromagnetic Bandgap (AI-EBG) Structure-Based Power Distribution Network (PDN)	Jinwoo Choi; Govind, V.; Swaminathan, M.; Bharath, K.	Advanced Packaging, IEEE Transactions on	20100301	This paper presents efficient noise isolation and suppression method in mixed-signal systems using alternating impedance electromagnetic bandgap (AI-EBG) structure-based power distribution network (PDN). Currently, split planes are used for isolation in mixed-signal systems for isolating sensitive RF/analog circuits from noisy digital circuits. However, split planes show good isolation only at low frequencies due to electromagnetic coupling through the gap. The AI-EBG structure-based PDN presented in this paper provides excellent isolation (-80 dB  -100 dB) in the frequency range of interest by suppressing almost all possible electromagnetic modes. The AI-EBG structure has been integrated into a mixed-signal test vehicle to demonstrate the isolation level achievable. The ability of the AI-EBG structure to suppress switching noise has been quantified in this paper. The AI-EBG structure provided greater than 100 dB of isolation in passive S-parameter measurement and suppressed in-band noise down to -88 dBm of isolation in a functional test.

Power-dependent and polarization-dependent experiments demonstrate that the red UCL originates from Eu3+ two-photon simultaneous absorption rather than second harmonic generation of nonlinear optical crystal followed by reabsorption of Eu3+. Two different kinds of Eu3+-centers, called Eu3+-pairs, are revealed via emission spectra. Besides using femtosecond laser excitation to simulate diode laser excitation with broad line, the efficient two-photon simultaneous absorption can populate more Eu3+ to upper levels, these are beneficial to the study of cross relaxation with submicrosecond resolution between Eu3+-pairs occurred in practical application. Transient UCL spectra and decay curves suggest that the luminescent state 5D0 is fed by way of both multiphonon relaxation through state 5D1 and cross relaxation of 5D2+7F0?5D0+7F5.	europium;high-speed optical techniques;lithium compounds;luminescence;nonlinear optics;optical harmonic generation;optical pumping4265Ky;4265Re;4279Nv,

The trap ionization energy at zero-field in BPFMO films is deduced to be around 0.29 eV, which indicates the existence of shallow traps. A negative differential resistivity behavior is observed before the onset of PF emission at 93 K, which is discussed in terms of the competition between electron trapping and field-assisted thermal emission.

730	Approximation Algorithms for a Link Scheduling Problem in Wireless Relay Networks with QoS Guarantee	Chi-Yao Hong; Ai-Chun Pang; Pi-Cheng Hsiu	Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20101028	The emerging wireless relay networks (WRNs) are expected to provide significant improvement on throughput and extension of coverage area for next-generation wireless systems. We study an optimization problem for multihop link scheduling with bandwidth and delay guarantees over WRNs. Our optimization problem is investigated under a more general interference model with a generic objective. The objective can be based on various kinds of performance indexes (e.g., throughput, fairness, and capacity), which can be determined by service providers. Through our theoretical analysis, the intractability and inapproximability of the optimization problem are shown. Due to the intractable computational complexity, we present efficient algorithms to provide a reasonable small approximation factor against any optimal solution even for a worst-case input. Furthermore, some experimental results indicate that our algorithms yield near-optimal performance in the average case.

731	An underlap field-effect transistor for electrical detection of influenza	Lee, Kwang-Won; Sung-Jin Choi; Ahn, J.-H.; Moon, Dong-Il; Tae Jung Park; Sang Yup Lee; Choi, Yang-Kyu	Applied Physics Letters	20100126	An underlap channel-embedded field-effect transistor (FET) is proposed for label-free biomolecule detection. Specifically, silica binding protein fused with avian influenza (AI) surface antigen and avian influenza antibody (anti-AI) were designed as a receptor molecule and a target material, respectively. The drain current was significantly decreased after the binding of negatively charged anti-AI on the underlap channel. A set of control experiments supports that only the biomolecules on the underlap channel effectively modulate the drain current. With the merits of a simple fabrication process, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatibility, and enhanced sensitivity, the underlap FET could be a promising candidate for a chip-based biosensor.

732	Monte Carlo Tree Search in Lines of Action	Winands, M.H.M.; Bjornsson, Y.; Saito, J.-T.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20110117	The success of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in many games, where ??-based search has failed, naturally raises the question whether Monte Carlo simulations will eventually also outperform traditional game-tree search in game domains where ?? -based search is now successful. The forte of ??-based search are highly tactical deterministic game domains with a small to moderate branching factor, where efficient yet knowledge-rich evaluation functions can be applied effectively. In this paper, we describe an MCTS-based program for playing the game Lines of Action (LOA), which is a highly tactical slow-progression game exhibiting many of the properties difficult for MCTS. The program uses an improved MCTS variant that allows it to both prove the game-theoretical value of nodes in a search tree and to focus its simulations better using domain knowledge. This results in simulations superior in both handling tactics and ensuring game progression. Using the improved MCTS variant, our program is able to outperform even the world's strongest ??-based LOA program. This is an important milestone for MCTS because the traditional game-tree search approach has been considered to be the better suited for playing LOA.

Photonics Journal, IEEE	20100610	While InGaAs absorption material has been used for various applications up to 1.6-?m wavelength, specific designs for low-level detection have become of main interest using high responsivity and low-dark-current detectors. By adding an avalanche multiplication layer to form an avalanche photodiode (APD) using the Separated Absorption and Multiplication (SAM) structure, one can take advantage of the very low-noise properties of the multiplication process in large-bandgap AI(Ga)(ln)As material to improve receiver sensitivity by > 10 dB. Under high-power-level injection, specific PIN structures have been developed to improve space charge effects and linear operation as needed for power applications such as high bit rates using coherent detection or analog photonic links. Specific designs to achieve simultaneously broad bandwidth, high responsivity, very high power saturation, and high linearity will be discussed.

737	Moving-Target Pursuit Algorithm Using Improved Tracking Strategy	Mingliang Xu; Zhigeng Pan; Hongxing Lu; Yangdong Ye; Pei Lv; El Rhalibi, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100311	Pursuing a moving target in modern computer games presents several challenges to situated agents, including real-time response, large-scale search space, severely limited computation resources, incomplete environmental knowledge, adversarial escaping strategy, and outsmarting the opponent. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking automatic optimization moving-target pursuit (TAO-MTP) algorithm employing improved tracking strategy to effectively address all challenges above for the problem involving single hunter and single prey. TAO-MTP uses a queue to store prey's trajectory, and simultaneously runs real-time adaptive A* (RTAA*) repeatedly to approach the optimal position updated periodically in the trajectory within limited steps, which makes the overall pursuit cost smallest. In the process, the hunter speculatively moves to any position explored in the trajectory, not necessarily the optimal position, to speed up convergence, and then directly moves along the trajectory to pursue the prey. Moreover, automatic optimization methods, such as reducing trajectory storage and optimizing pursuit path, are used to further enhance its performance. As long as the hunter's moving speed is faster than that of the prey, and its sense scope is large enough, it will eventually capture the prey. Experiments using commercial game maps show that TAO-MTP is independent of adversarial escaping strategy, and outperforms all the classic and state-of-the-art moving-target pursuit algorithms such as extended moving-target search (eMTS), path refinement moving-target search (PR MTS), moving-target adaptive A* (MTAA*), and generalized adaptive A* (GAA*).

738	The Parametrized Probabilistic Finite-State Transducer Probe Game Player Fingerprint Model	Tsang, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20100913	Fingerprinting operators generate functional signatures of game players and are useful for their automated analysis independent of representation or encoding. The theory for a fingerprinting operator which returns the length-weighted probability of a given move pair occurring from playing the investigated agent against a general parametrized probabilistic finite-state transducer (PFT) is developed, applicable to arbitrary iterated games. Results for the distinguishing power of the 1-state opponent model, uniform approximability of fingerprints of arbitrary players, analyticity and Lipschitz continuity of fingerprints for logically possible players, and equicontinuity of the fingerprints of bounded-state probabilistic transducers are derived. Algorithms for the efficient computation of special instances are given; the shortcomings of a previous model, strictly generalized here from a simple projection of the new model, are explained in terms of regularity condition violations, and the extra power and functional niceness of the new fingerprints demonstrated. The 2-state deterministic finite-state transducers (DFTs) are fingerprinted and pairwise distances computed; using this the structure of DFTs in strategy space is elucidated.

Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20100527	Cognitive radio (CR) is an enabling technology for numerous new capabilities such as dynamic spectrum access, spectrum markets, and self-organizing networks. To realize this diverse set of applications, CR researchers leverage a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To help researchers better understand the practical implications of AI to their CR designs, this paper reviews several CR implementations that used the following AI techniques: artificial neural networks (ANNs), metaheuristic algorithms, hidden Markov models (HMMs), rule-based systems, ontology-based systems (OBSs), and case-based systems (CBSs). Factors that influence the choice of AI techniques, such as responsiveness, complexity, security, robustness, and stability, are discussed. To provide readers with a more concrete understanding, these factors are illustrated in an extended discussion of two CR designs.

742	Automatic Content Generation in the Galactic Arms Race Video Game	Hastings, E.J.; Guha, R.K.; Stanley, K.O.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091231	Simulation and game content includes the levels, models, textures, items, and other objects encountered and possessed by players during the game. In most modern video games and in simulation software, the set of content shipped with the product is static and unchanging, or at best, randomized within a narrow set of parameters. However, ideally, if game content could be constantly and automatically renewed, players would remain engaged longer. This paper introduces two novel technologies that take steps toward achieving this ambition: 1) a new algorithm called content-generating NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (cgNEAT) is introduced that automatically generates graphical and game content while the game is played, based on the past preferences of the players, and 2) Galactic Arms Race (GAR), a multiplayer video game, is constructed to demonstrate automatic content generation in a real online gaming platform. In GAR, which is available to the public and playable online, players pilot space ships and fight enemies to acquire unique particle system weapons that are automatically evolved by the cgNEAT algorithm. A study of the behavior and results from over 1000 registered online players shows that cgNEAT indeed enables players to discover a wide variety of appealing content that is not only novel, but also based on and extended from previous content that they preferred in the past. Thus, GAR is the first demonstration of evolutionary content generation in an online multiplayer game. The implication is that with cgNEAT it is now possible to create applications that generate their own content to satisfy users, potentially reducing the cost of content creation and increasing entertainment value from single-player to massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) with a constant stream of evolving content.

A predistorter based on generalized normalized gradient descent algorithm is proposed. The merit of the GNGD algorithm is that its learning rate provides compensation for the independent assumptions in the derivation of NLMS, thus its stability is improved. Computer simulation shows that the proposed predistorter is very robust. It can overcome the sensitivity of initialization parameters and get a better linearization performance.	generalized normalized gradient descent;memory polynomial;orthog-onal frequency division multiplexing;power amplifier predistortion,Algorithm design and analysis;OFDM;Polynomials;Predistortion;Robustness;Signal processing algorithms							
744	Effective and Diverse Adaptive Game AI	Szita, I.; Ponsen, M.; Spronck, P.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090502	Adaptive techniques tend to converge to a single optimum. For adaptive game AI, such convergence is often undesirable, as repetitive game AI is considered to be uninteresting for players. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically learning diverse but effective macros that can be used as components of adaptive game AI scripts. Macros are learned by a cross-entropy method (CEM). This is a selection-based optimization method that, in our experiments, maximizes an interestingness measure. We demonstrate the approach in a computer role-playing game (CRPG) simulation with two duelling wizards, one of which is controlled by an adaptive game AI technique called ldquodynamic scripting.rdquo Our results show that the macros that we learned manage to increase both adaptivity and diversity of the scripts generated by dynamic scripting, while retaining playing strength.

The diode utilizes a sandwich structure formed by placing CdSe/CdS NCs between two layers of Si and AgxO, which act as electron- and hole-transporting materials, respectively. The photoluminescence properties of NCs are rendered less dependent upon surface chemistry and chemical environment by growing a thick CdS shell. It also enhances stability of the NCs during the process of magnetron sputtering for silicon deposition. The resulting LED device exhibits a low turn-on voltage of 2.5 V and the maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 0.08%.

Welding of this alloy is an indispensable processing method, so the microstructures and mechanical properties of these welded joints must be studied to improve the welds. Longitudinal three-point bending tests were conducted to measure the bending ductility of laser beam welded joints. The crack distribution and fracture surface were investigated to further analyze the fracture behavior. The results indicate that the bending ductility decreases as the heat input by the laser beam welding increases. The crack inducing strain reaches 4.24%, while the fracturing strain exceeds 5% when the heat input is below 316 J/cm. If the columnar crystal grain of the weld metal exhibits a uniform orientation, the bending ductility is worse. The fractography analysis shows that the cracking propagates transgranularly and the fracture surface has a cleavage mode.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090811	This paper presents an evolutionary, game theoretic approach to simulate and study the collective outcome of public goods (PG) provisioning in an agent-based model. Using asymmetric information as the basis for decision making, distinct groups are configured to interact in an iterated N player PG game, where coevolutionary learning is used as the adaptation tool to the dynamic environment. Impact of information type, number of players, group size, rate of interaction, number of available choices, nature of PG provision, and selection schemes are studied under a variety of settings. Simulation results reveal interesting dynamics of strategy and usage profiles, level of derived welfare, and the evolution of cooperation. Analysis of simulated attributes offers a more holistic understanding into the nature of collective action and insights of how the effects of social dilemma can be mitigated. This might provide a good guide to achieve efficient PG provision in the practical context.

Learning Technologies, IEEE Transactions on	20090717	This paper describes a deployed simulation-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for training of tactical action officers (TAOs). The TAO on board a Navy ship is responsible for the operation of the entire watch team manning the ship's command center. The ITS goal is to train the TAO in ldquocommand by negation,rdquo in which watchstanders perform their duties autonomously, while the TAO supervises, intervening in order to correct mistakes and rectify omissions. The ITS uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to provide Automated Role Players (ARPs) representing the watchstanders in the ship, and to provide a natural language interface to communicate with these automated teammates. An adaptive coaching strategy is used to provide coaching and feedback during an exercise. The paper presents a discussion of the ITS instructional design, its architecture, and the AI techniques it employs.

Different from the past work on the designs of cryptography algorithms and system infrastructures, we aim at the proposing of a dynamic routing algorithm that could randomize delivery paths for data transmission. The algorithm is easy to implement and compatible with popular routing protocols, such as routing information protocol in wired networks and destination-sequenced distance vector protocol in wireless networks, without introducing extra control messages. An analytic study on the proposed algorithm is presented, and a series of simulation experiments are conducted to verify the analytic results and to show the capability of the proposed algorithm.

758	Approximating the Set of Pareto-Optimal Solutions in Both the Decision and Objective Spaces by an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm	Aimin Zhou; Qingfu Zhang; Yaochu Jin	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20090922	Most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms aim at approximating the Pareto front (PF), which is the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the objective space. In many real-life applications, however, a good approximation to the Pareto set (PS), which is the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the decision space, is also required by a decision maker. This paper considers a class of multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), in which the dimensionalities of the PS and the PF manifolds are different so that a good approximation to the PF might not approximate the PS very well. It proposes a probabilistic model-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called MMEA, for approximating the PS and the PF simultaneously for an MOP in this class. In the modeling phase of MMEA, the population is clustered into a number of subpopulations based on their distribution in the objective space, the principal component analysis technique is used to estimate the dimensionality of the PS manifold in each subpopulation, and then a probabilistic model is built for modeling the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the decision space. Such a modeling procedure could promote the population diversity in both the decision and objective spaces. MMEA is compared with three other methods, KP1, Omni-Optimizer and RM-MEDA, on a set of test instances, five of which are proposed in this paper. The experimental results clearly suggest that, overall, MMEA performs significantly better than the three compared algorithms in approximating both the PS and the PF.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for joint routing and link scheduling in WRNs. The developed theoretical analysis indicates that the performance of the proposed algorithm is within a factor of three of that of any optimal algorithm in the worst case. Through simulation experiments, the numerical results show that our algorithm outperforms the previously proposed routing and link-scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can effectively achieve near-optimal performance, and provide much better throughput than the theoretical worst-case bound in the average case.

763	Intelligent SINS/RDSS integrated algorithms for land vehicle navigation	Xiaofeng He; Xiaoping Hu; Wenqi Wu; Meiping Wu	Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, IEEE	20090403	This is a discussion of the design of strap-down inertial navigation systems (SINS) and radio determination satellite service (RDSS) integrated navigation algorithms. The research aims at testing the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-aided Kalman filtering (KF) approaches for land vehicle applications. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN)-aided K*F algorithm and a fuzzy inference-based KF algorithm are presented in order to overcome the time delay of RDSS positioning provided by a double-star positioning system in China. Traditional KF causes biased solutions, and indeed, leads to filter instability easily since the time delay of RDSS positioning, in an active mode, is hard to be modeled and sometimes suffers from RDSS outages. Therefore, a fuzzy inference is used to correct the variance matrix of KE measurement noises adaptively; and a trained BPNN corrects the outputs of the Kalman filter. The algorithms proposed herein have been verified on real SINSIRDSS data. collected in land vehicle tests and are compared with other approaches. The results demonstrate that fuzzy inference-based KF algorithms improve the positioning accuracy to over 40 % better than KF algorithms, and BPNN-aided KF algorithms have the same precision as GPS which is the reference station In dynamic experiments without RDSS outages. The test results with RDSS outages indicate that the fuzzy inference-based KF is feasible but with positioning errors of hundreds of meters, so the BPNN-aided KF is designed to efficiently compensate for RDSS outages and improve system performance.	,Artificial intelligence;Delay effects;Fuzzy systems;Inference algorithms;Intelligent vehicles;Land vehicles;Radio navigation;Satellite navigation systems;Silicon compounds;Testing,Global Positioning System;backpropagation;fuzzy set theory;inertial navigation;neural nets;telecommunication computingChina;GPS;Global Positioning System;artificial intelligence aided Kalman filtering approaches;back-propagation neural network;double-star positioning system;fuzzy inference;land vehicle navigation;radio determination satellite service integrated navigation algorithm;strap-down inertial navigation system;variance matrix							
764	Generation of Adaptive Dilemma-Based Interactive Narratives	Barber, H.; Kudenko, D.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091231	The generator of adaptive dilemma-based interactive narratives (GADIN) presented in this paper dynamically generates interactive narratives which are focused on dilemmas to create dramatic tension. The system is provided with knowledge of generic story actions and dilemmas based on those clichE??s encountered in many storytelling domains. The domain designer is only required to provide domain-specific information, for example, regarding characters and their relationships, locations, and actions. A planner creates sequences of actions that all lead to a dilemma for a character (who can be the user). The user interacts with the storyworld by making decisions on relevant dilemmas and by freely choosing their own actions. Using this input, the system chooses and adapts future storylines according to the user's past behavior. Previous interactive narrative systems often have content creation and ordering requirements that restrict the possibility for sustaining the dramatic interest of the narrative over a long time period. In addition, many of these systems are not easily transferable between domains. In this paper, the GADIN system is demonstrated to both be able to maintain the dramatic interest of generated narratives over a long time period and to have a core architecture that is applicable to any domain.

766	Activation of Immune Response in Disease Dynamics via Controlled Drug Scheduling	Hyeygjeon Chang; Astolfi, A.	Automation Science and Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20090331	The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), is a dynamic process that can be modeled via differential equations. The primary goal of this paper is to introduce a control philosophy to boost the response of the immune system by means of drug scheduling. The control purpose is to steer the system to an equilibrium condition known as long-term nonprogressor, which corresponds to an infected patient that does not develop the symptoms of AIDS. The feasibility of the control methodology is illustrated via simulations on two HIV dynamic models and on a general disease model.

767	Rapid and Reliable Adaptation of Video Game AI	Bakkes, S.; Spronck, P.; van den Herik, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090811	Current approaches to adaptive game AI typically require numerous trials to learn effective behavior (i.e., game adaptation is not rapid). In addition, game developers are concerned that applying adaptive game AI may result in uncontrollable and unpredictable behavior (i.e., game adaptation is not reliable). These characteristics hamper the incorporation of adaptive game AI in commercially available video games. In this paper, we discuss an alternative to these current approaches. Our alternative approach to adaptive game AI has as its goal adapting rapidly and reliably to game circumstances. Our approach can be classified in the area of case-based adaptive game AI. In the approach, domain knowledge required to adapt to game circumstances is gathered automatically by the game AI, and is exploited immediately (i.e., without trials and without resource-intensive learning) to evoke effective behavior in a controlled manner in online play. We performed experiments that test case-based adaptive game AI on three different maps in a commercial real-time strategy (RTS) game. From our results, we may conclude that case-based adaptive game AI provides a strong basis for effectively adapting game AI in video games.

Energy transfer (ET) from Nd3+ to Yb3+ then to Tm3+ is very important in this UC emission process. The overlapping between the emissions of 1D2?3F4 and 1G4?3H6, which makes up of blue emission band, is confirmed by transient investigation. From the pump energy dependence investigation, it is known that the dominant populating mechanism for the 1G4 state is the two-photon process, and that for 1D2 is the three-photon process. In our UC emission model, the 1G4 state is populated by the ET of 2F5/2(Yb3+)+3H4(Tm3+)?2F7/2(Yb3+)+1G4(Tm3+), 1D2 state is populated by the ET of 3F2+3H4?1D2+3H6 among Tm3+ ions. For LiNbO3 crystals doped with Tm3+ to the concentration of 0.9ﾠmol %, the measured lifetimes of 1G4 and 1D2 are ?80 and 4ﾠ?s.	high-speed optical techniques;lithium compounds;multiphoton processes;neodymium;nonradiative transitions;optical frequency conversion;thulium;ytterbium4265Ky;7847Cd;7855Hx,							
771	Experimental Study on Multigap Multichannel Gas Spark Closing Switch for LTD	Xuandong Liu; Fengju Sun; Tianxue Liang; Xiaofeng Jiang; Qiaogen Zhang; Aici Qiu	Plasma Science, IEEE Transactions on	20090630	In this paper, a multigap multichannel gas spark closing switch (MMCS) has been modified to improve the synchronous closing characteristics of ten switches designed for linear transformer driver (LTD). Convexo-convex discal electrodes have been used instead of the plane toroidal electrodes to improve the electric field across the gaps. A new endo-grooved plane bracing structure has been designed for fixing the electrodes instead of the small ball anchoring method to ensure the length of the gap uniformity. In order to observe the discharge process of the MMCS, the transparent lucite insulation chambers instead of the nylon ones have been used. A test circuit comprising a single discharge circuit called LTD brick has been established to investigate the self-breakdown and triggered breakdown characteristics of ten switches. The results show that when switches are filled with pure nitrogen of 0.14 MPa and charged to plusmn60 kV, the synchronous discharge of ten MMCSs has output a current pulse with an amplitude of about 100 kA and a rise time of 100 ns.

772	Effects of Shared Perception on the Evolution of Squad Behaviors	Doherty, D.; O'Riordan, C.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090502	As the nonplayable characters (NPCs) of squad-based shooter computer games share a common goal, they should work together in teams and display cooperative behaviors that are tactically sound. Our research examines genetic programming (GP) as a technique to automatically develop effective squad behaviors for shooter games. GP has been used to evolve teams capable of defeating a single powerf.ul enemy agent in a number of environments without the use of any explicit team communication. This paper is an extension of our paper presented at the 2008 Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE'08). Its aim is to explore the effects of shared perception on the evolution of effective squad behaviors. Thus, NPCs are given the ability to explicitly communicate their perceived information during evolution. The results show that the explicit communication of perceived information between team members enables an improvement in average team effectiveness.

775	Opportunistic spectrum access based on a constrained multi-armed bandit formulation	Ai, Jing; Abouzeid, A.A.	Communications and Networks, Journal of	20121221	Tracking and exploiting instantaneous spectrum opportunities are fundamental challenges in opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) in presence of the bursty traffic of primary users and the limited spectrum sensing capability of secondary users. In order to take advantage of the history of spectrum sensing and access decisions, a sequential decision framework is widely used to design optimal policies. However, many existing schemes, based on a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, reveal that optimal policies are non-stationary in nature which renders them difficult to calculate and implement. Therefore, this work pursues stationary OSA policies, which are thereby efficient yet low-complexity, while still incorporating many practical factors, such as spectrum sensing errors and a priori unknown statistical spectrum knowledge. First, with an approximation on channel evolution, OSA is formulated in a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework. As a result, the optimal policy is specified by the well-known Gittins index rule, where the channel with the largest Gittins index is always selected. Then, closed-form formulas are derived for the Gittins indices with tunable approximation, and the design of a reinforcement learning algorithm is presented for calculating the Gittins indices, depending on whether the Markovian channel parameters are available a priori or not. Finally, the superiority of the scheme is presented via extensive experiments compared to other existing schemes in terms of the quality of policies and optimality.

777	A Master Equation Formalism for Macroscopic Modeling of Asynchronous Irregular Activity States	El Boustani, S; Destexhe, A	Neural Computation	20140519	Many efforts have been devoted to modeling asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which resemble the complex activity states seen in the cerebral cortex of awake animals. Most of models have considered balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons in which AI states are sustained through recurrent sparse connectivity, with or without external input. In this letter we propose a mesoscopic description of such AI states. Using master equation formalism, we derive a second-order mean-field set of ordinary differential equations describing the temporal evolution of randomly connected balanced networks. This formalism takes into account finite size effects and is applicable to any neuron model as long as its transfer function can be characterized. We compare the predictions of this approach with numerical simulations for different network configurations and parameter spaces. Considering the randomly connected network as a unit, this approach could be used to build large-scale networks of such connected units, with an aim to model activity states constrained by macroscopic measurements, such as voltage-sensitive dye imaging.

779	Relationship Between Generalization and Diversity in Coevolutionary Learning	Siang Yew Chong; Tino, P.; Xin Yao	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091201	Games have long played an important role in the development and understanding of coevolutionary learning systems. In particular, the search process in coevolutionary learning is guided by strategic interactions between solutions in the population, which can be naturally framed as game playing. We study two important issues in coevolutionary learning - generalization performance and diversity - using games. The first one is concerned with the coevolutionary learning of strategies with high generalization performance, that is, strategies that can outperform against a large number of test strategies (opponents) that may not have been seen during coevolution. The second one is concerned with diversity levels in the population that may lead to the search of strategies with poor generalization performance. It is not known if there is a relationship between generalization and diversity in coevolutionary learning. This paper investigates whether there is such a relationship in coevolutionary learning through a detailed empirical study. We systematically investigate the impact of various diversity maintenance approaches on the generalization performance of coevolutionary learning quantitatively using case studies. The problem of the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game is considered. Unlike past studies, we can measure both the generalization performance and the diversity level of the population of evolved strategies. Results from our case studies show that the introduction and maintenance of diversity do not necessarily lead to the coevolutionary learning of strategies with high generalization performance. However, if individual strategies can be combined (e.g., using a gating mechanism), there is the potential of exploiting diversity in coevolutionary learning to improve generalization performance. Specifically, when the introduction and maintenance of diversity lead to a speciated population during coevolution, where each specialist strategy is capable of outperforming- - different opponents, the population as a whole can have a significantly higher generalization performance compared to individual strategies.

780	Improvement in Resolution of Laser Capture Microdissection Using Near-Field Probe to Capture Nanoparticles	Chien-Ming Chen; Jen-Ai Lee; Chi-Fu Yen	NanoBioscience, IEEE Transactions on	20090731	Purpose: A modified laser capture micro-dissection (LCM) system is developed to improve resolution to 400 nm, using a laser light (808 nm) transmitted by a near-field tip probe. Materials and methods: Using a 150-nm aperture to heat an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) film, melted spots on the average of 400 nm in diameter are generated on the underlying target composed of a 20-nm gold-particle monolayer. The near-field tip probe composed of fiber is set on a 2-D nanometer piezoactuator (PZT) for precise capturing of the monolayer of gold particles. The monolayer of gold particles under the target is bound to the EVA film using a laser, while the remaining EVA film stays on the monolayer. Results: The diameter of the melted spots as small as 400 nm are produced and details are provided that demonstrate the feasibility of the nano-operation of this new LCM system. Conclusion: The new LCM system successfully captures nanoparticles and improves resolution of micro-dissection to 400 nm. With this LCM system, the isolation of a single organelle or bacterium is possible.

781	Design of Ternary Signals for MIMO Identification in the Presence of Noise and Nonlinear Distortion	Ai Hui Tan; Godfrey, K.R.; Barker, H.A.	Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20090623	A new approach to designing sets of ternary periodic signals with different periods for multi-input multi-output system identification is described. The signals are pseudo-random signals with uniform nonzero harmonics, generated from Galois field GF(q), where q is a prime or a power of a prime. The signals are designed to be uncorrelated, so that effects of different inputs can be easily decoupled. However, correlated harmonics can be included if necessary, for applications in the identification of ill-conditioned processes. A design table is given for q les 31. An example is presented for the design of five uncorrelated signals with a common period N = 168 . Three of these signals are applied to identify the transfer function matrix as well as the singular values of a simulated distillation column. Results obtained are compared with those achieved using two alternative methods.

It is found that the nanowelding could be accomplished at a temperature much lower than the melting point of the metal, during which a side contact structure and core filling nanowires form at the CNT-metal interface. Metal atoms prefer entering into the core to moving along the outer surface of the CNTs. Also, the filling of the metal atoms into the CNT can enhance the local melting of the metal at the interface, which would facilitate the metal atoms wetting on the outer walls and dramatically increasing the contact length.	carbon nanotubes;materials preparation;melting point;molecular dynamics method;nanotechnology;nanowires;nickel;welding;wetting

784	Reference Resolution Challenges for Intelligent Agents: The Need for Knowledge	McShane, M.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20090724	"Natural language processing (NLP) is as yet far from achieving human levels of sophistication. This isn't surprising if we consider that people are amazing processors of language who leverage all of their knowledge of language, the speech context and the world in every language situation. A domain in which the divergence between the abilities of people and the abilities of machines is particularly manifest is reference resolution. Reference resolution is best defined as interpreting the meaning of each referring expression in a language input - like my finger, JFK, them, ran - and anchoring it in the mental model (memory) of the intelligent agent processing that input. This semantics-oriented, memory-oriented view of reference resolution is inspired by what people seem to accomplish when resolving reference. It stands in contrast to the more widely pursued NLP task of coreference resolution, whose final goal is to match coreferential text strings (words and phrases) with each other, typically with little or no connection to text meaning or memory population and management. This article provides an example-oriented overview of reference phenomena that are difficult for intelligent agents to process, as well as the types of knowledge, rendered machine tractable, that seem to be required to process them. We begin with a short introduction to ""deep semantic"" text processing, an approach to NLP that is currently not widely pursued but seems necessary to tackle problems like advanced reference resolution. Next comes an extended example that provides a concrete picture of the problem space in question. Then the full scope of reference phenomena is juxtaposed with the much narrower scope of phenomena that has been treated in systems to date. Comparisons are drawn between the primarily knowledge-lean approach, which has dominated the field so far, and the primarily knowledge-rich approach, which seems necessary for difficult phenomena. Following that are seven high-level qu- estions and their answers that highlight some key challenges faced by reference resolving agents. The article concludes with some thoughts about what to do next in order to make significant progress on reference resolution. The organizational style - example-driven and Q&A - was selected to provide a more engaging introduction to the topic than would a formal, linguistically motivated classification."	ai;human-level intelligence;ieee intelligent systems;linguistics;natural language,Cognitive science;Fingers;Humans;Intelligent agent;Memory management;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Radio access networks;Speech processing;Text processing,computational linguistics;natural language processing;software agents;text analysisNLP;deep semantic text processing;intelligent agent;knowledge-lean approach;knowledge-rich approach;machine tractable knowledge;natural language processing;reference phenomena;reference resolution;speech context

Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20090321	This paper presents a new phase-unwrapping (PU) algorithm for SAR interferometry that makes use of a particle filter (PF) to perform simultaneously noise filtering and PU.

786	Query-Enabled Behavior Trees	Florez-Puga, G.; Gomez-Martin, M.A.; Gomez-Martin, P.P.; Diaz-Agudo, B.; Gonzalez-Calero, P.A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091231	Artificial intelligence in games is typically used for creating player's opponents. Manual editing of intelligent behaviors for nonplayer characters (NPCs) of games is a cumbersome task that needs experienced designers. Our research aims to assist designers in this task. Behaviors typically use recurring patterns, so that experience and reuse are crucial aspects for behavior design. The use of hierarchical structures like hierarchical state machines, behavior trees (BTs), or hierarchical task networks, allows working on different abstraction levels reusing pieces from the more detailed levels. However, the static nature of the design process does not release the designer from the burden of completely specifying each behavior. Our approach applies case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques to retrieve and reuse stored behaviors represented as BTs. In this paper, we focus on dynamic retrieval and selection of behaviors taking into account the world state and the underlying goals. The global behavior of the NPC is dynamically built at runtime querying the CBR system. We exemplify our approach through a serious game, developed by our research group, with gameplay elements from first-person shooter (FPS) games.

The approach used in this paper differs from those implemented in traditional pedestrian-detection systems, which are designed to localize all pedestrians in the area in front of the vehicle. Conversely, this approach searches for pedestrians in critical areas only. The environment is reconstructed with a standard laser scanner, whereas the following check for the presence of pedestrians is performed due to the fusion with a vision system. The great advantages of such an approach are that pedestrian recognition is performed on limited image areas, therefore boosting its timewise performance, and no assessment on the danger level is finally required before providing the result to either the driver or an onboard computer for automatic maneuvers. A further advantage is the drastic reduction of false alarms, making this system robust enough to control nonreversible safety systems.

796	Correlation-Based Motion Vector Processing With Adaptive Interpolation Scheme for Motion-Compensated Frame Interpolation	Ai-Mei Huang; Truong Nguyen	Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on	20090310	In this paper, we address the problems of unreliable motion vectors that cause visual artifacts but cannot be detected by high residual energy or bidirectional prediction difference in motion-compensated frame interpolation. A correlation-based motion vector processing method is proposed to detect and correct those unreliable motion vectors by explicitly considering motion vector correlation in the motion vector reliability classification, motion vector correction, and frame interpolation stages. Since our method gradually corrects unreliable motion vectors based on their reliability, we can effectively discover the areas where no motion is reliable to be used, such as occlusions and deformed structures. We also propose an adaptive frame interpolation scheme for the occlusion areas based on the analysis of their surrounding motion distribution. As a result, the interpolated frames using the proposed scheme have clearer structure edges and ghost artifacts are also greatly reduced. Experimental results show that our interpolated results have better visual quality than other methods. In addition, the proposed scheme is robust even for those video sequences that contain multiple and fast motions.

797	Use of Kernel Functions in Artificial Immune Systems for the Nonlinear Classification Problems	Ozsen, S.; Gunes, S.; Kara, S.; Latifoglu, F.	Information Technology in Biomedicine, IEEE Transactions on	20090706	Due to the fact that there exist only a small number of complex systems in artificial immune systems (AISs) that solve nonlinear problems, there is a need to develop nonlinear AIS approaches that would be among the well-known solution methods. In this study, we developed a kernel-based AIS to compensate for this deficiency by providing a nonlinear structure via transformation of distance calculations in the clonal selection models of classical AIS to kernel space. Applications of the developed system were conducted on Statlog heart disease dataset, which was taken from the University of California, Irvine Machine-Learning Repository, and on Doppler sonograms to diagnose atherosclerosis disease. The system obtained a classification accuracy of 85.93% for the Statlog heart disease dataset, while it achieved a 99.09% classification success for the Doppler dataset. With these results, our system seems to be a potential solution method, and it may be considered as a suitable method for hard nonlinear classification problems.

798	Chess Programs and Other Tools		Chess Metaphors:Artificial Intelligence and the Human Mind	20120924	When we play the ancient and noble game of chess, we grapple with ideas about honesty, deceitfulness, bravery, fear, aggression, beauty, and creativity, which echo (or allow us to depart from) the attitudes we take in our daily lives. Chess is an activity in which we deploy almost all our available cognitive resources; therefore, it makes an ideal laboratory for investigation into the workings of the mind. Indeed, research into artificial intelligence (AI) has used chess as a model for intelligent behavior since the 1950s. In Chess Metaphors, Diego Rasskin-Gutman explores fundamental questions about memory, thought, emotion, consciousness, and other cognitive processes through the game of chess, using the moves of thirty-two pieces over sixty-four squares to map the structural and functional organization of the brain. Rasskin-Gutman focuses on the cognitive task of problem solving, exploring it from the perspectives of both biology and AI. Examining AI researchers' efforts to program a computer that could beat a flesh-and-blood grandmaster (and win a world chess championship), he finds that the results fall short when compared to the truly creative nature of the human mind.								
799	Evaluation of Delays Induced by Foundation Fieldbus H1 Networks	Qingfeng Li; Rankin, D.J.; Jin Jiang	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20090911	The delays associated with the use of foundation fieldbus (FF) H1 networks within control loops are investigated in this paper. A Smar IF302 device, a Smar FI302 device, a DeltaV distributed control system (DCS), a Honeywell C300 DCS, and a National Instrument (NI) FF H1 workstation are used to implement test loops with the control-in-the-field architecture. Analytical and experimental evaluations are performed with a test loop using hardwired analog channels as a benchmark. Three segments of FF-H1-network-induced delays are identified, their analytical models are developed, and suggestions to potentially reduce the delays are provided. Furthermore, it is found that an unexpected additional delay of one macrocycle may be introduced, probably depending on whether the analog input (AI) block within the IF302 device is executed as scheduled. In conclusion, significant delays could be introduced if the traditional analog channels of a DCS are replaced by an FF H1 network.

Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, IEEE	20090922	This focuses on the classification task performed into a multi-sensor system for the coastal surveillance. The system is composed of two platforms of sensors: a land-based platform equipped with a land based radar, an Automatic Identification System (AIS) and an infrared camera (IR); an airborne platform carrying an airborne radar that can operate in a spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode, a video camera, and a second IR camera. The tasks performed by the system are the detection, tracking, identification, and classification of multiple targets, the evaluation of their threat level, and the selection of an intervention on them. The classification algorithm implemented inside the system exploits an analytical approach based on the confusion matrix (CM) of the imaging sensors that belong to the system.

803	Low acoustic attenuation silicone rubber lens for medical ultrasonic array probe	Itsumi, K.; Hosono, Y.; Yamamoto, N.; Yamashita, Y.	Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, IEEE Transactions on	20090421	Effects of heavy density (p = 9.2 x 103 kg/m3) Yb2O3 fine dopant (16 nm in diameter) on the acoustic properties of a high-temperature-vulcanization (HTV) silicone rubber have been investigated, to develop a new acoustic lens material with a low acoustic attenuation (alpha) for the medical array probe application. The HTV silicone rubber has advantages in that it shows a lower alpha than that of a room-temperature-vulcanization (RTV) silicone rubber and it can be mixed by applying shear stress, using roll-milling equipment. Roll-milling time dependence of the HTV silicone rubber indicates that the alpha is closely affected by the dispersion of nanopowders in the rubber matrix. The 8 vol% Yb2O3-doped HTV silicone rubber mixed for 30 min showed the lowest alpha of 0.73 dB/mmMHz with an acoustic impedance [AI = sound speed (c) times density (p)] of 1.43 times 106 kg/m2s at 37degC. Moreover, simulation results reveal that a 5 MHz linear probe using the HTV silicone rubber doped with Yb2O3 powder showed relative sensitivity around 2.6 to 3.0 dB higher than a probe using RTV silicone rubber doped with Yb2O3 powder or SiO2-doped conventional silicone rubber for the ultrasonic medical application.	,Acoustic applications;Acoustic arrays;Acoustic materials;Attenuation;Biomedical acoustics;Lenses;Optical materials;Powders;Probes;Rubber,acoustic impedance;acoustic materials;biomedical ultrasonics;milling;rolling;silicone rubber;ultrasonic absorption;ultrasonic focusing;ultrasonic imaging;vulcanisation;ytterbium compoundsacoustic attenuation;acoustic impedance;acoustic lens material;high-temperature-vulcanization silicone rubber;low acoustic attenuation silicone rubber lens;medical ultrasonic array probe;nanopowders;roll-milling equipmentComputer-Aided Design;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Lenses;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Silicone Elastomers;Transducers;Ultrasonography							
804	Novel statistical processing methods for wireless field strength prediction	Li Bo; Zhang-dui, Zhong; Zhu Gang; Liu Jian-ping	Consumer Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20100112	This paper mainly deals with the statistical processing methods in wireless filed strength prediction process after sampling data are collected. The conventional standard for data collection and statistical processing in the prediction of wireless filed strength is Lee's criteria. It utilizes linear averaging to process sampling data, as many other related papers discussed. However, the accuracy of such first order moment estimation is low, especially under serious Rayleigh fading channels. As regards to the defects of the method, we propose four novel statistical processing methods to process the collected data for wireless field strength. Computer simulations and corresponding analysis verify its much better prediction results with small estimation variances.

805	Principles and Demonstration of Intrabody Communication With a Sensitive Electrooptic Sensor	Sasaki, A.; Shinagawa, M.; Ochiai, K.	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20090106	We have investigated the basic principles of intrabody communication with a newly developed ridge-type electrooptic (EO) sensor. To intuitively understand the essence of intrabody communication, we introduced a simple model based on the fact that human body can approximately be considered as a conductor wrapped in an insulator. To demonstrate the propriety of the model, we measured the characteristics of communication systems including a human body using the EO sensor. The experimental results well agree with the predictions from the model. The new ridge-type EO sensor is shown to be superior to our previous EO sensor, both in sensitivity and in stability. With the ridge-type EO sensor, we succeeded in 10-Mb/s data transmission through the human body. Furthermore, we discussed the advantages of using the EO sensor for intrabody communication.

807	Adaptive Experience Engine for Serious Games	Bellotti, F.; Berta, R.; De Gloria, A.; Primavera, L.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091231	Designing games that support knowledge and skill acquisition has become a promising frontier of education techniques, since games are able to capture the user concentration for long periods and can present users with realistic and compelling challenges. In this scenario, there is a need for scientific and engineering methods to build games not only as more realistic simulations of the physical world but as means to provide effective learning experiences. Abstracting state of the art serious games' (SGs) features, we propose a new design methodology for the sand box serious games (SBSGs) class, decoupling content from the delivery strategy during the gameplay. This methodology aims at making design more efficient and standardized in order to meet the growing demand for interactive learning. The methodology consists in modeling an SBSG as a hierarchy of tasks (e.g., missions) and specifies the requirements for a runtime scheduling policy that maximizes learning objectives in a full entertainment context. The policy is learned by an experience engine (EE) based on computational intelligence. In this approach, the domain-expert author focuses on the creation and semantic annotation of tasks. Tasks are put in a repository and can then be exploited by game designers who define the expected learning curve and other requirements about education and entertainment for the game. The task sequencing that aims at matching such specifications with the real user profile is then presented to the EE. The EE can operate also in absence of the specification of the learning curve, continuously adapting the game flow without aiming at the achievement of target knowledge levels predefined by the author. We have implemented an EE module based on genetic computation and reinforcement learning (RL) atop of a state-of-the-art game engine. Test results show that the EE is able to define in real-time missions that meet the requirements expressed by the author.

808	In/Er-codoped LiNbO3 crystals with enhanced 1.5ﾠ?m emission and suppressed upconversion emission	Liang Sun; Yang, Chun-Hui; Li, Ai-Hua; Xu, Yu-Heng; Zhao, Lian-Cheng	Journal of Applied Physics	20090624	1.5ﾠ?m emission and green upconversion emission properties in In/Er-codoped LiNbO3 crystals were investigated by using both steady-state and time-resolved emission spectra. The 1.5ﾠmol % In2O3 codoping results in the lengthening of 1.5ﾠ?m emission lifetime by 13.9% and simultaneously the shortening of 550 nm green upconversion emission lifetime by 52.5%. The decay behavior of the green upconversion emission of the In/Er-codoped crystal shows obviously nonexponential. These spectroscopic characteristics are related with the lower concentration of the cluster sites of Er3+ ion and possible cross-relaxation energy transfer processes. The above emission results are further supported by the theoretical emission results based on JuddﾖOfelt theory.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090811	In this paper, a resource allocation and call admission control scheme based on game theory for satellite networks operating above 10 GHz is introduced, taking into account the propagation conditions and large propagation delay. The resource allocation scheme based on a bargaining model, which may be completed in a very short time, seems to be suitable for providing emergency services. A distributed call admission control algorithm exploiting the predictability of the satellite channel to guarantee quality of service (QoS) is also presented. According to the suggested scheme, each user unilaterally decides whether to accept a new call and, if all users unanimously agree, the new call is admitted. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated using Markov chain modeling. Finally, analytical results concerning bounds for the call blocking probability and the system throughput are presented.

Below the superconducting transition temperature TC, the nanobridge exhibits a series of sharp voltage steps as a function of current. The multiple voltage steps are interpreted as a consequence of spatially localized phase slip centers or hot-spot formation in the bridge. Just below the critical current, the voltages versus current curve shows a power-law behavior in the low temperature region, but Ohmic near the TC. The thermally activated phase slip, quantum phase slip, and imhomogeneity in a one-dimensional superconducting system may contribute to the observed results.	critical currents;focused ion beam technology;lead;molecular beam epitaxial growth;nanostructured materials;silicon;slip;superconducting thin films;superconducting transition temperature;type I superconductors

The probabilistic nature of the strongest neighbor (SN) measurement in a cluttered environment is shown to be varied with respect to the number of validated measurements. Incorporating the number of validated measurements into design of the PSNF produces a consistent and cost effective data association method. Simulation studies show that the new filter is less sensitive to the unknown spatial clutter density and is more reliable for practical target tracking in nonhomogeneous clutter than the existing PSNF. It has similar performances to the probabilistic data association filter amplitude information (PDAF-AI) with much less computational complexities.	,Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Contracts;Costs;Current measurement;Information filtering;Information filters;Probability;Target tracking;Tin,costing;filtering theory;probability;sensor fusioncomputational complexities;cost effective;data association;probabilistic strongest neighbor filter;validated measurements

815	Automated Scoring of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Hypopnea Events Using Short-Term Electrocardiogram Recordings	Khandoker, A.H.; Gubbi, J.; Palaniswami, M.	Information Technology in Biomedicine, IEEE Transactions on	20091103	Obstructive sleep apnea or hypopnea causes a pause or reduction in airflow with continuous breathing effort. The aim of this study is to identify individual apnea and hypopnea events from normal breathing events using wavelet-based features of 5-s ECG signals (sampling rate = 250 Hz) and estimate the surrogate apnea index (AI)/hypopnea index (HI) (AHI). Total 82 535 ECG epochs (each of 5-s duration) from normal breathing during sleep, 1638 ECG epochs from 689 hypopnea events, and 3151 ECG epochs from 1862 apnea events were collected from 17 patients in the training set. Two-staged feedforward neural network model was trained using features from ECG signals with leave-one-patient-out cross-validation technique. At the first stage of classification, events (apnea and hypopnea) were classified from normal breathing events, and at the second stage, hypopneas were identified from apnea. Independent test was performed on 16 subjects' ECGs containing 483 hypopnea and 1352 apnea events. The cross-validation and independent test accuracies of apnea and hypopnea detection were found to be 94.84% and 76.82%, respectively, for training set, and 94.72% and 79.77%, respectively, for test set. The Bland-Altman plots showed unbiased estimations with standard deviations of plusmn 2.19, plusmn 2.16, and plusmn 3.64 events/h for AI, HI, and AHI, respectively. Results indicate the possibility of recognizing apnea/hypopnea events based on shorter segments of ECG signals.

819	An Adaptive Contention Control Strategy for IEEE 802.15.4-Based Wireless Sensor Networks	Hsueh-Wen Tseng; Ai-Chun Pang; Jenhui Chen; Chin-Fu Kuo	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20091110	The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is able to achieve low-power transmissions in low-rate and short-distance wireless personal area networks (WPANs). Due to the constitutional design of the sensor node and the transmission architecture (client-server model), any data communication between two sensor nodes will involve the coordinator. One shortcoming of redundant channel-access steps will result in excessive contention overheads and, thus, the decrease of channel utilization. This paper proposes an adaptive contention control strategy (ACCS) to solve the problem of transmission efficiency in IEEE 802.15.4. ACCS can be implemented in the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control (MAC) protocol standard adding no new message type. An analytic model and a simulation model are developed to evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 and ACCS. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the goodput, the average queuing delay, the average MAC delay, and the energy consumption.

Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20090527	A bottom-up approach for documenting art objects processes data from innovative nondestructive analysis with signal processing and neural network techniques to provide a good estimation of the paint layer profile and pigments of artwork. The approach also uses semantic Web technologies and maps concepts relevant to the analysis of paintings and Byzantine iconography to the Conceptual Reference Model of the International Committee for Documentation (CIDOC-CRM). This approach has introduced three main contributions: the development of an integrated nondestructive technique system combining spectroscopy and acoustic microscopy, supported by intelligent algorithms, for estimating the artworks' paint layers profile; mapping of analytical data pertinent to the diagnosis of art paintings to CIDOC-CRM to demonstrate how semantic Web technologies can benefit cultural heritage; and the introduction of a practical setting that combines different AI fields.

821	Using AI to Access and Experience Cultural Heritage	Hardman, L.; Aroyo, L.; van Ossenbruggen, J.; Hyvonen, E.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20090324	The digital age is transforming cultural heritage in methods of both creation and preservation. Whereas once we collected objects such as books, sculptures, statues, and paintings, we now also face the preservation and the archiving of digital artifacts. These might be digital representations of physical objects or purely digital creations that are culturally significant and worthy of preservation in their own right, such as interactive works of art, blogs, or even the World Wide Web itself. Intelligent systems can be used at different stages of creation, identification, preservation, authentication, and retrieval of these digital assets.

822	CadiaPlayer: A Simulation-Based General Game Player	Bjornsson, Y.; Finnsson, H.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090502	The aim of general game playing (GGP) is to create intelligent agents that can automatically learn how to play many different games at an expert level without any human intervention. The traditional design model for GGP agents has been to use a minimax-based game-tree search augmented with an automatically learned heuristic evaluation function. The first successful GGP agents all followed that approach. In this paper, we describe CadiaPlayer, a GGP agent employing a radically different approach: instead of a traditional game-tree search, it uses Monte Carlo simulations for its move decisions. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate different simulation-based approaches on a wide variety of games, introduce a domain-independent enhancement for automatically learning search-control knowledge to guide the simulation playouts, and show how to adapt the simulation searches to be more effective in single-agent games. CadiaPlayer has already proven its effectiveness by winning the 2007 and 2008 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) GGP competitions.

826	Extending the Applicability of Pattern and Endgame Databases	Samadi, M.; Asr, F.T.; Schaeffer, Jonathan; Azimifar, Z.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090502	For most high-performance two-player game programs, a significant amount of time is devoted to developing the evaluation function. An important issue in this regard is how to take advantage of a large memory. For some two-player games, endgame databases have been an effective way of reducing search effort and introducing accurate values into the search. For some one-player games (single-agent domains or puzzles), pattern databases have been effective at improving the quality of the heuristic values used in a search. This paper introduces new ways to extend the utility of pattern and endgame databases. Through the use of abstraction: (1) single-agent pattern databases can be applied to two- or more-player games; knowledge of the capabilities of one player (being oblivious to the opponent) can be an effective evaluation function for a class of game domains, and (2) endgame database positions can be viewed as an abstraction of more complicated positions; database lookups can be used as evaluation function features. These ideas are illustrated using the games of Chinese Checkers, Chess, and Thief and Police. For each domain, even small databases can be used to produce strong game play. This research has relevance to the recent interest in building general game-playing (GGP) programs. For two- or more-player applications where pattern and/or endgame databases can be built, abstraction can be used to automatically construct an evaluation function.

827	Towards the development of intelligent navigation support systems for group shipping and global marine traffic control	Kawaguchi, A.; Inaishi, M.; Kondo, H.; Kondo, M.	Intelligent Transport Systems, IET	20090911	Computerised navigation is a developing technology in a branch of autonomous and intelligent engineering systems. It aims to enhance safety and security at sea and to improve the reliability of ship-to-ship operations and global marine traffic control. A recently standardised automatic identification system (AIS) takes full advantage of GPS based real-time positioning and timing information of ships. The use of the AIS is steadily growing to meet the needs of the merchant shipping and fishing industries. Nevertheless, a significant decrease in the number of ship accidents and hazardous incidents in open waterways has yet to occur. The work gathered in this paper is to establish a proactive means to prevent marine accidents by the use of the full potential of the AIS. Specifically, this paper describes the development of an AIS synthesis capable navigation support system enhanced with a degree of intelligence built from a physical model suitable to capture the dynamics of group based navigation of ocean-going vessels. The system envisioned is to provide adequate decision making support for group shipping, especially during the critical maneuvering in restricted areas such as channel passing and harbour approaches. Foundations for and experimental results of this study, including an analysis with the simulated traffic of Tokyo Uraga Channel route, are presented.

829	A Nonlinear Tracking Controller for Voltage-Fed Induction Motors With Uncertain Load Torque	Karagiannis, D.; Astolfi, A.; Ortega, R.; Hilairet, M.	Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20090424	In this paper, a new adaptive output feedback control scheme for the full-order (voltage-fed) model of the induction motor is presented. The proposed algorithm uses measurements of the stator currents and rotor speed and achieves global asymptotic convergence of the rotor speed and flux magnitude to their desired (time-varying) references. The distinguishing feature of the proposed scheme, which makes it appealing from a practical viewpoint, is that it consists of a simple output feedback control law, which is derived using standard arguments pertaining to Hamiltonian systems and passivity-based control. In order to make the scheme robust to load torque variations, an adaptation mechanism is added, which yields asymptotic estimates of the unknown load torque, and a rigorous stability proof for the resulting cascaded closed-loop system is provided. The efficacy of the proposed controller is verified via simulations and experimental tests.

Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20090310	Ni-Cr-based thin-film resistors have been fabricated and studied at temperatures of down to 50 mK. The resistivity of the films varied within (14-25)Omega*sq, depending on the additions of Cu, Al, Ge, and Mn. The minimum temperature coefficient (TC) at 4.2 K (TC = -50 middot 10 -6/K) is obtained for Ni75Cr20CU2.5AI2.5 (Evanohm alloy) doped with 2.5% Ge. At the 50-150 mK range, the TC of the alloy increases to -4.15 middot 10 -6/mK. The resistors demonstrate the Kondo minimum at 20-30 K. The power coefficient of the 560-kOmega sample, which was measured at 4.2 K, was found to be les -0.008 middot 10 -6/muW. Power dependence measurements at subkelvin temperatures showed an electron overheating at the power level of above 10 p W for a 500-k film resistor.

To access the objective that the designed robust filter is maximally tolerant to disturbances and sensitive to fault, the robustness and stability properties of the fault diagnosis scheme are established rigorously. Using the residual vector, a fault tolerant controller is established in order to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system, and the controller law can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Then, some relevant sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are given by applying Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a simulation example is performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	linear matrix inequality;nonlinear network control systems;observer;robust fault detection,Control systems;Delay;Fault detection;Filtering theory;Observers;Robustness;Vectors

This study focuses on the invited games played in the tournament Taiwanese Go players versus the computer program MoGo held at the National University of Tainan (NUTN), Tainan, Taiwan. Several Taiwanese Go players, including one 9-Dan (9D) professional Go player and eight amateur Go players, were invited by NUTN to play against MoGo from August 26 to October 4, 2008. The MoGo program combines all-moves-as-first (AMAF)/rapid action value estimation (RAVE) values, online ""upper confidence tree (UCT)-like"" values, offline values extracted from databases, and expert rules. Additionally, four properties of MoGo are analyzed including: (1) the weakness in corners, (2) the scaling over time, (3) the behavior in handicap games, and (4) the main strength of MoGo in contact fights. The results reveal that MoGo can reach the level of 3 Dan (3D) with: (1) good skills for fights, (2) weaknesses in corners, in particular, for ""semeai"" situations, and (3) weaknesses in favorable situations such as handicap games. It is hoped that the advances in AI and computational power will enable considerable progress in the field of computer Go, with the aim of achieving the same levels as computer chess or Chinese chess in the future."

834	FDTD-PWS Scheme and Its Application to Analysis of Focusing Properties of Dielectric Lens	Yan Zhang; Shan-wei Lu; Jun Zhang; Jungang Miao; Ning Fang; Bao-fa Wang	Antennas and Propagation, IEEE Transactions on	20090505	The focusing properties of lens are studied by a hybrid scheme that involves the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for the aperture-plane field computation and the plane wave spectrum (PWS) method for the transformation from the aperture-plane field to the focal-plane field. To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this new scheme, a Ka-band lens antenna is simulated and fabricated as an example. Subsequently, the near-field-region and the Fresnel-region fields of this lens antenna are measured by the planar-near-field (PNF) method. It is found that the results obtained by the FDTD-PWS scheme are in good agreement with the measured data. Furthermore, the numerical results and the computational requirements of this new scheme are compared with those of the near-field to near-field (NF-NF) transformation, the aperture integration (AI) method, the geometrical optics (GO)-physical optics (PO) method, and the full FDTD simulation. Both the central processing unit (CPU) time and memory requirement can be reduced efficiently. Finally, the effects of several fundamental issues, including spatial sample parameters, lens material, operating frequency, and designed focal length, on the accuracy of the proposed scheme and on the focusing properties of the lens are investigated.

835	Proactive Mediation in Plan-Based Narrative Environments	Harris, J.; Young, R.M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091201	In interactive plan-based narrative environments, users' actions must be monitored to ensure that conditions necessary for the execution of narrative plans are not compromised. In the Zocalo system, management of user actions has been performed on a reactionary basis by a process called mediation. In this paper, we describe an extension to this approach, proactive mediation, which calculates responses to user input in an anticipatory manner. A proactive mediation module accepts as input a plan describing the actions being performed by the user (generated by a plan recognition system) and identifies portions of that plan that jeopardize the causal structure of the overall narrative. Once these portions are identified, proactive mediation generates modifications to the narrative plan structure that avoid the unwanted interaction between user and story. This extension to the original mediation algorithm provides more responses to a user's actions and generates responses that are tailored to the user's activity.

836	Markov Logic:An Interface Layer for Artificial Intelligence		Markov Logic:An Interface Layer for Artificial Intelligence	20140702	Most subfields of computer science have an interface layer via which applications communicate with the infrastructure, and this is key to their success (e.g., the Internet in networking, the relational model in databases, etc.). So far this interface layer has been missing in AI. First-order logic and probabilistic graphical models each have some of the necessary features, but a viable interface layer requires combining both. Markov logic is a powerful new language that accomplishes this by attaching weights to first-order formulas and treating them as templates for features of Markov random fields. Most statistical models in wide use are special cases of Markov logic, and first-order logic is its infinite-weight limit. Inference algorithms for Markov logic combine ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo, belief propagation, and resolution. Learning algorithms make use of conditional likelihood, convex optimization, and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been su cessfully applied to problems in information extraction and integration, natural language processing, robot mapping, social networks, computational biology, and others, and is the basis of the open-source Alchemy system.

838	What Do We Know about Large-scale Changes of Aerosols, Clouds, and the Radiation Budget?		Clouds in the Perturbed Climate System:Their Relationship to Energy Balance, Atmospheric Dynamics, and Precipitation	20120924	In this chapter we examine how aerosol and cloud fields undergo perturbations by anthropogenic activities. Recent surface observations and satellite remote sensing have detected signatures of large-scale changes in the atmospheric aerosol amounts, associated changes in the cloud fraction, and microphysical structures on a global scale. Models can simulate these signatures fairly well, but problems still remain. Fields of anthropogenic aerosol optical depth (AOD) from several atmospheric models have been found to be consistent with the spatial pattern obtained from satellite data. Further studies are needed to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic aerosols and to interpret observed temporal and regional trends in aerosol parameters. The strength of the cloud-aerosol interaction can be characterized by the regression of AOD or aerosol index (AI) on cloud droplet number (Nc). From recent studies, the corresponding slopes dlog(Nc)/ dlog(A) vary between 0.19 and 0.7. Further work is needed to see whether such variability is the result of methodological problems or differences in cloud environments for which the studies have established the cloud-aerosol relation.

840	Development and Specification of a Reference Model for Agent-Based Systems	Regli, W.C.; Mayk, I.; Dugan, C.J.; Kopena, J.B.; Lass, R.N.; Modi, P.J.; Mongan, W.M.; Salvage, J.K.; Sultanik, E.A.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on	20090818	Agent-based systems have been the object of intense research over the past decade. While great theoretical progress has been made, the software frameworks for creating agent-based systems offer considerable variability in their capabilities and functionality. This paper introduces a reference model for agent-based systems. The purpose of a reference model is to provide a common conceptual basis for comparing systems and driving the development of software architectures and other standards. The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents and other groups have advanced a number of agent standards, yet, to date, no comprehensive reference model has been presented for software systems composed of agents. This paper provides an overview of a reference model for agent-based systems. The agent systems reference model is the result of a multiyear effort studying software systems built with agents and software frameworks for implementing these systems. As part of this study, the team applied software reverse engineering techniques to perform static and dynamic analysis of operational agent-based systems. This analysis enabled identification of key common concepts across over one dozen different agent frameworks. To demonstrate its applicability, the reference model is then used to analyze a number of complete agent-based software systems. It is the belief of the authors that the reference model will be an essential prerequisite for future transition, deployment, and integration of agent-based systems.

841	Internet Sites for Playing Chess		Chess Metaphors:Artificial Intelligence and the Human Mind	20120924	When we play the ancient and noble game of chess, we grapple with ideas about honesty, deceitfulness, bravery, fear, aggression, beauty, and creativity, which echo (or allow us to depart from) the attitudes we take in our daily lives. Chess is an activity in which we deploy almost all our available cognitive resources; therefore, it makes an ideal laboratory for investigation into the workings of the mind. Indeed, research into artificial intelligence (AI) has used chess as a model for intelligent behavior since the 1950s. In Chess Metaphors, Diego Rasskin-Gutman explores fundamental questions about memory, thought, emotion, consciousness, and other cognitive processes through the game of chess, using the moves of thirty-two pieces over sixty-four squares to map the structural and functional organization of the brain. Rasskin-Gutman focuses on the cognitive task of problem solving, exploring it from the perspectives of both biology and AI. Examining AI researchers' efforts to program a computer that could beat a flesh-and-blood grandmaster (and win a world chess championship), he finds that the results fall short when compared to the truly creative nature of the human mind.

The performance characterization was made on the electronics part and as a photon detector from the response to reset signals and to laser. The electronics operation was affected by radiation-induced charge accumulation in the oxide layers. Detailed evaluation of the characteristics changes in the transistors was separately carried out using transistor test structures to which a wider range of irradiation, from 0.12 kGy to 5.1 MGy, was made with 60Co gamma's.

843	Real-Time Intravascular Shear Stress in the Rabbit Abdominal Aorta	Lisong Ai; Hongyu Yu; Wangde Dai; Hale, S.L.; Kloner, R.A.; Hsiai, T.K.	Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20090610	Fluid shear stress is intimately linked with the biological activities of vascular cells. A flexible microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensor was developed to assess spatial- and temporal-varying components of intravascular shear stress (ISS) in the abdominal aorta of adult New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits. Real-time ISS (ISSreal-time) was analyzed in comparison with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for wall shear stress (WSS). Three-dimensional abdominal arterial geometry and mesh were created using the GAMBIT software. Simulation of arterial flow profiles was established by FLUENT. The Navier-Stokes equations were solved for non-Newtonian blood flow. The coaxial-wire-based MEMS sensor was deployed into the abdominal arteries of rabbits via a femoral artery cutdown. Based on the CFD analysis, the entrance length of the sensor on the coaxial wire (0.4 mm in diameter) was less than 10 mm. Three-dimensional fluoroscope and contrast dye allowed for visualization of the positions of the sensor and ratios of vessel to coaxial wire diameters. Doppler ultrasound provided the velocity profiles for the CFD boundary conditions. If the coaxial wire were positioned at the center of vessel, the CFD analysis revealed a mean ISS value of 31.1 with a systolic peak at 102.8 dyn ldr cm-2. The mean WSS was computed to be 10.1 dyn ldr cm-2 with a systolic peak at 33.2 dynldrcm-2, and the introduction of coaxial wire increased the mean WSS by 5.4 dyn ldr cm-2 and systolic peak by 18.0 dyn ldr cm-2. Experimentally, the mean ISS was 11.9 dyn ldr cm-2 with a systolic peak at 47.0 dyn ldr cm-2. The waveform of experimental ISS was similar to that of CFD solution with a 30.2% difference in mean and 8.9% in peak systolic shear stress. Despite the difference between CD and experimental results, the flexible coaxial-wire-based MEMS sensors provided a possibility to assess real-time ISS in the- - abdominal aorta of NZW rabbits.

847	Analysis of Animal-Related Outages in Overhead Distribution Systems With Wavelet Decomposition and Immune Systems-Based Neural Networks	Min Gui; Pahwa, A.; Das, S.	Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20091020	Outages in overhead distribution systems caused by different factors significantly impact their reliability. Since animals cause large number of outages in overhead distribution systems, analysis of these outages has a practical value as it allows utilities to keep track of historical trends. This paper presents a methodology for yearend analysis of animal-caused outages in the past year. Models to estimate weekly animal-caused outages in overhead distribution systems using combination of wavelet transform techniques and neural networks are presented. Discrete wavelet transform is applied to decompose the time series of weekly animal-caused outages into two components and separate neural networks are constructed for each decomposed coefficient series. The outputs of neural networks are combined according to wavelet reconstruction techniques to get estimated results for the weekly animal-caused outages. Artificial immune system (AIS) is used to overcome the overtraining problem associated with neural networks. Results obtained for four districts in Kansas of different sizes are compared with observed outages to evaluate performance of three different models for estimating these outages.

848	Fingerprint Analysis of the Noisy Prisoner's Dilemma Using a Finite-State Representation	Ashlock, D.; Eun-Youn Kim; Ashlock, W.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090811	Fingerprinting is a technique that permits automatic classification of strategies for playing a game. In this paper, the evolution of strategies for playing the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) at three different noise levels is analyzed using fingerprinting and other techniques including a novel quantity, evolutionary velocity, derived from fingerprinting. The results are at odds with initial expectations and permit the detection of a critical difference in the evolution of agents with and without noise. Noise during fitness evaluation places a larger fraction of an agent's genome under selective pressure, resulting in substantially more efficient training. In this case, efficiency is the production of superior competitive ability at a lower evolutionary velocity. Prisoner's dilemma playing agents are evolved for 6400 generations, taking samples at eight exponentially spaced epochs. This permits assessment of the change in populations over long evolutionary time. Agents are evaluated for competitive ability between those evolved for different lengths of time and between those evolved using distinct noise levels. The presence of noise during agent training is found to convey a commanding competitive advantage. A novel analysis is done in which a tournament is run with no two agents from the same evolutionary line and one third of agents from each noise level studied. This analysis simulates contributed agent tournaments without any genetic relation between agents. It is found that in early epochs the agents evolved without noise have the best average tournament rank, but that in later epochs they have the worst.

851	Simulation of the Dynamics of Nonplayer Characters' Emotions and Social Relations in Games	Ochs, M.; Sabouret, N.; Corruble, V.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091231	One of the main challenges faced by the video game industry is to give life to believable nonplayer characters (NPCs). Research shows that emotions play a key role in determining the behavior of individuals. In order to improve the believability of NPCs' behavior, we propose in this paper a model of the dynamics of emotions taking into account the personality and the social relations of the character. First, we present work from the literature on emotions, personality, and social relations in computer science and in human and social sciences. We focus on the influence of personality on the triggering of emotions, and the influence of emotions on the dynamics of social relations. Based on this work, we propose a dynamic model of the socioemotional state and its implementation as part of a tool for game programmers. This tool aims at the simulation of the evolution of emotions and social relations of NPCs based on their personality and roles.

Mg patterns with a minimum width of 5ﾠ?m were obtained by using maskless vacuum evaporation. The selective deposition originates in the difference of glass transition temperature, microscopically, of surface molecular motion between polymerized and nonpolymerized photopolymer surfaces. The difference between photoreactive small molecules and polymers was also discussed. The selective metal deposition method would be applied to a wide range of organic surfaces; this method showed great potential for the preparation of fine wiring for various organic electronic devices.	glass transition;magnesium;optical polymers;polymer films;polymerisation;vacuum deposition4270Jk;6470P-;6855am;8115Ef,

855	Optimal Stochastic Policies for Distributed Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks	Zhenzhen Ye; Abouzeid, A.A.; Jing Ai	Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on	20091013	The scenario of distributed data aggregation in wireless sensor networks is considered, where sensors can obtain and estimate the information of the whole sensing field through local data exchange and aggregation. An intrinsic tradeoff between energy and aggregation delay is identified, where nodes must decide optimal instants for forwarding samples. The samples could be from a node's own sensor readings or an aggregation with samples forwarded from neighboring nodes. By considering the randomness of the sample arrival instants and the uncertainty of the availability of the multiaccess communication channel, a sequential decision process model is proposed to analyze this problem and determine optimal decision policies with local information. It is shown that, once the statistics of the sample arrival and the availability of the channel satisfy certain conditions, there exist optimal control-limit-type policies that are easy to implement in practice. In the case that the required conditions are not satisfied, the performance loss of using the proposed control-limit-type policies is characterized. In general cases, a finite-state approximation is proposed and two on-line algorithms are provided to solve it. Practical distributed data aggregation simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed policies, which also achieve a desired energy-delay tradeoff.

857	Index		Chess Metaphors:Artificial Intelligence and the Human Mind	20120924	When we play the ancient and noble game of chess, we grapple with ideas about honesty, deceitfulness, bravery, fear, aggression, beauty, and creativity, which echo (or allow us to depart from) the attitudes we take in our daily lives. Chess is an activity in which we deploy almost all our available cognitive resources; therefore, it makes an ideal laboratory for investigation into the workings of the mind. Indeed, research into artificial intelligence (AI) has used chess as a model for intelligent behavior since the 1950s. In Chess Metaphors, Diego Rasskin-Gutman explores fundamental questions about memory, thought, emotion, consciousness, and other cognitive processes through the game of chess, using the moves of thirty-two pieces over sixty-four squares to map the structural and functional organization of the brain. Rasskin-Gutman focuses on the cognitive task of problem solving, exploring it from the perspectives of both biology and AI. Examining AI researchers' efforts to program a computer that could beat a flesh-and-blood grandmaster (and win a world chess championship), he finds that the results fall short when compared to the truly creative nature of the human mind.

860	Planning-Based Narrative Generation in Simulated Game Universes	Hsueh-Min Chang; Von-Wun Soo	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091201	An agent-based social simulation is one way to add a story to simulated game universes within the game mechanics while preserving the autonomy of nonplay characters (NPCs). In this paper, we add a social reasoning element behind NPC actions to make their plans more story like. An AI planner is developed to combine plan search and logic inference about others' minds. An NPC agent equipped with the planner uses actions to change others' minds, and uses such mental changes to achieve its goal. We review the question of whether stories do arise from agent-based simulations by examining actual narrative segments generated by our NPC agents, and by an experimental exploration of the frequencies and lengths of narrative segments. A story facilitator, named divine intervention operator service (DIOS), makes stories happen when they are impossible via on-the-fly adjustment of character personalities.

In this paper load modeling during asymmetric disturbances (LMAD) is proposed. LMAD may collect data during asymmetric disturbances which occur more often in power systems. Some measured data are chosen to testify LMAD with satisfying results which not only validate the method but also are applied in power system simulation now. LMAD is promising in load modeling since it does not need extra field tests and special data acquisition instruments, both of which hardly get approval of utilities. Furthermore, the conditions on the uniqueness of identified load model parameters are discussed. Some characteristics like electromagnetic torque of the load model are studied as well.

863	Iterative Coded Modulation With Code Rate Flexibility for Optical Space Communications	Ying Tan; Jian-Zhong Guo; Yong Ai	Photonics Technology Letters, IEEE	20090109	We propose an iterative coded modulation technique with code rate flexibility for optical space communications. It is a modified version of the existing SCPPM, which consists of the serial concatenation of an outer convolutional code, an interleaver, a bit-accumulator, and pulse-position modulation (PPM), and has been demonstrated to give the best performance on an optical link modeled as PPM/Poisson channels. The primary modification is to add a single-parity-check (SPC) code. We refer to the coded modulation as SPC-SCPPM. The two codes are decoded with an iterative demodulator-decoder, using standard turbo-decoding techniques. We compare the two coded modulation techniques on a PPM/Poisson channel. The rate-1/2 SPC-SCPPM provides performance similar to the SCPPM of the same parameters. However, SPC-SCPPM has been shown to possess code rate flexibility for all rates higher than 1/2 in contrast to SCPPM.

864	Runtime Behavior Adaptation for Real-Time Interactive Games	Mehta, M.; Ram, A.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20091201	Intelligent agents working in real-time domains need to adapt to changing circumstance so that they can improve their performance and avoid their mistakes. AI agents designed for interactive games, however, typically lack this ability. Game agents are traditionally implemented using static, hand-authored behaviors or scripts that are brittle to changing world dynamics and cause a break in player experience when they repeatedly fail. Furthermore, their static nature causes a lot of effort for the game designers as they have to think of all imaginable circumstances that can be encountered by the agent. The problem is exacerbated as state-of-the-art computer games have huge decision spaces, interactive users, and real-time performance that make the problem of creating AI approaches for these domains harder. In this paper, we address the issue of nonadaptivity of game playing agents in complex real-time domains. The agents carry out runtime adaptation of their behavior sets by monitoring and reasoning about their behavior execution to dynamically carry out revisions on the behaviors. The behavior adaptation approaches have been instantiated in two real-time interactive game domains. The evaluation results show that the agents in the two domains successfully adapt themselves by revising their behavior sets appropriately.

865	Analogue input shaper for haptic interfaces	Lim, Y.-A.; Ahn, H.-S.; Ryu, J.	Control Theory & Applications, IET	20091211	An analogue input shaper (AIS) is proposed as a means for stably increasing the displayable impedance range of haptic interfaces. Usually, high-frequency inputs can occur during collisions with very stiff virtual objects and induce instabilities. The proposed AIS is basically a nonlinear low-pass filter and acts as a frequency-dependent dissipative element, which can eliminate unwanted high-frequency inputs to haptic interfaces. The proposed AIS is not placed in the power stage but in the signal stage, so that the AIS can be designed independent of motor parameters and does not affect transparency in free motion. In addition, two linear half-wave rectifiers are incorporated into the AIS to allow for a fast decrease of impedance and no negative input to the haptic interface when a haptic pointer leaves a virtual object. Through virtual wall experiments using two different haptic interfaces, the effectiveness of the proposed AIS is shown.	haptic interfaces;low-pass filters;nonlinear filters;rectifiers;virtual realityanalogue input shaper;frequency-dependent dissipative element;haptic interface;linear half-wave rectifier;nonlinear low-pass filter;virtual wall experiment

Information Technology in Biomedicine, IEEE Transactions on	20090901	The diagnosis of thyroid malignancy by fine needle aspiration (FNA) examination has been proven to show wide variations of sensitivity and specificity. This paper proposes the utilization of a computer-aided diagnosis system based on a supervised classification algorithm from the artificial immune systems to assist the task of thyroid malignancy diagnosis. The core of the proposed algorithm is the so-called BoxCells, which are defined as parallelepipeds in the feature space. Properly defined operators act on the BoxCells in order to convert them into individual, elementary classifiers. The proposed algorithm is applied on FNA data from 2016 subjects with verified diagnosis and has exhibited average specificity higher than 99%, 90% sensitivity, and 98.5% accuracy. Furthermore, 24% of the cases that are characterized as ldquosuspiciousrdquo by FNA and are histologically proven nonmalignancies have been classified correctly.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090502	With characters in computer games and interactive media increasingly being based on real actors, the individuality of an actor's performance should not only be reflected in the appearance and animation of the character but also in the AI that governs the character's behavior and interactions with the environment. Machine learning methods applied to motion capture data provide a way of doing this. This paper presents a method for learning the parameters of a finite-state machine (FSM) controller. The method learns both the transition probabilities of the FSM and also how to select animations based on the current state.	3-D animation;Game AI;machine learning;motion capturecomputer animation;finite state machines;learning (artificial intelligence);motion estimationanimations;learning finite-state machine controllers;machine learning methods;motion capture data;transition probabilities

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090811	"A methodology for optimizing player satisfaction in games on the ""playware"" physical interactive platform is demonstrated in this paper. Previously constructed artificial neural network user models, reported in the literature, map individual playing characteristics to reported entertainment preferences for augmented-reality game players. An adaptive mechanism then adjusts controllable game parameters in real time in order to improve the entertainment value of the game for the player. The basic approach presented here applies gradient ascent to the user model to suggest the direction of parameter adjustment that leads toward games of higher entertainment value. A simple rule set exploits the derivative information to adjust specific game parameters to augment the entertainment value. Those adjustments take place frequently during the game with interadjustment intervals that maintain the user model's accuracy. Performance of the adaptation mechanism is evaluated using a game survey experiment. Results indicate the efficacy and robustness of the mechanism in adapting the game according to a user's individual playing features and enhancing the gameplay experience. The limitations and the use of the methodology as an effective adaptive mechanism for entertainment capture and augmentation are discussed."

872	Associative Classification With Artificial Immune System	Tien Dung Do; Siu Cheung Hui; Fong, A.C.M.; Fong, B.	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20090331	Associative classification (AC), which is based on association rules, has shown great promise over many other classification techniques. To implement AC effectively, we need to tackle the problems on the very large search space of candidate rules during the rule discovery process and incorporate the discovered association rules into the classification process. This paper proposes a new approach that we call artificial immune system-associative classification (AIS-AC), which is based on AIS, for mining association rules effectively for classification. Instead of massively searching for all possible association rules, AIS-AC will only find a subset of association rules that are suitable for effective AC in an evolutionary manner. In this paper, we also evaluate the performance of the proposed AIS-AC approach for AC based on large datasets. The performance results have shown that the proposed approach is efficient in dealing with the problem on the complexity of the rule search space, and at the same time, good classification accuracy has been achieved. This is especially important for mining association rules from large datasets in which the search space of rules is huge.

875	Real-Time Highway Traffic Condition Assessment Framework Using VehicleﾖInfrastructure Integration (VII) With Artificial Intelligence (AI)	Yongchang Ma; Chowdhury, M.; Sadek, A.; Jeihani, M.	Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20091201	This paper presents a framework for real-time highway traffic condition assessment using vehicle kinetic information, which is likely to be made available from vehicle-infrastructure integration (VII) systems, in which vehicle and infrastructure agents communicate to improve mobility and safety. In the proposed VII framework, the vehicle onboard equipment and roadside units (RSUs) collaboratively work, supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm, to determine the occurrence and characteristics of an incident. Two AI paradigms are examined: 1) support vector machines (SVMs) and 2) artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each RSU then assesses the traffic condition based on the information from multiple vehicles traveling on its supervised highway segment. As a case study, this paper developed a model of the VII-SVM framework and evaluated its performance in a microscopic traffic simulation environment for a highway network in Spartanburg, SC. The performance of the VII-SVM was compared with the performance of the corresponding VII-ANN framework, and both frameworks were found to be capable of classifying the travel experience using the kinetic data generated by each vehicle. The performance of the VII-SVM framework, in terms of its detection rate, false-alarm rate, and detection times, was also found to be superior to a baseline California-type incident-detection algorithm. Moreover, the framework provided additional information, including an estimate of the incident location and the likely number of lanes blocked, which will be helpful for implementing an appropriate response strategy. The proposed VII-AI framework thus provides a reliable alternative to traditional traffic sensors in assessing traffic conditions.

These opportunities also share a common set of challenges that deserve further attention. For example, competitive intelligence surveillance, which allows organizations to understand their current and potential competitors better, often requires the extraction of names of different organizations, technologies, or products from various S&T documents. When dealing with multilingual documents, adequate cross-lingual entity-resolution mechanisms are essential for effective global S&T analysis. Furthermore, some S&T documents are scientific or technologically oriented, whereas others have a predominantly business orientation. This increases the chance of different documents using different terms inreferring to identical or similar concepts.

Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090502	In this paper, we describe Twig, a fast, AI-friendly procedural animation system that supports easy authoring of new behaviors. The system provides a simplified dynamic simulation that is specifically designed to be easy to control. Characters are controlled by applying external forces directly to body parts, rather than by simulating joint torques. This ldquopuppetry-stylerdquo of control provides the simplicity of kinematic control within an otherwise dynamic simulation. Although less realistic than motion capture or full biomechanical simulation, Twig produces compelling, responsive character behavior. Moreover, it is fast, stable, supports believable physical interactions between characters such as hugging, punching, and dragging, and makes it easy to author new behaviors.

The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer achieves duty-cycle operations by setting two system parameters, macBeaconOrder (BO) and macSuperFrameOrder (SO), to achieve low power consumption for ZigBee devices. This study comprehensively analyzes IEEE 802.15.4 duty-cycle operation. Specifically, a novel analytical model that accommodates a general traffic distribution is developed. An NS-2 based simulation model, which is validated by the developed analytical model is also proposed. Through the experiments conducted by the analytical and simulation models, some important performance-evaluation insights are gained that can be used as guidelines for future low-power ZigBee network deployment.

881	Dynamic Intelligent Lighting for Directing Visual Attention in Interactive 3-D Scenes	El-Nasr, M.S.; Vasilakos, A.; Rao, C.; Zupko, J.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090811	Recent enhancements in real-time graphics have facilitated the design of high fidelity game environments with complex 3-D worlds inhabited by animated characters. Under such settings, it is hard, especially for the untrained eyes, to attend to an object of interest. Neuroscience research as well as film and theatre practice identified several visual properties, such as contrast, orientation, and color that play a major role in channeling attention. In this paper, we discuss an adaptive lighting design system called adaptive lighting for visual attention (ALVA) that dynamically adjusts the lighting color and brightness to enhance visual attention within game environments using features identified by neuroscience, psychophysics, and visual design literature. We also discuss some preliminary results showing the utility of ALVA in directing player's attention to important elements in a fast paced 3-D game, and thus enhancing the game experience especially for nongamers who are not visually trained to spot objects or characters in such complex 3-D worlds.

882	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games: A New IEEE Transactions	Lucas, S. M.	Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on	20090502	The author first provides an overview of computational intelligence and AI in games. Then he describes the new IEEE Transactions, which will publish archival quality original papers in all aspects of computational intelligence and AI related to all types of games. To name some examples, these include computer and video games, board games, card games, mathematical games, games that model economies or societies, serious games with educational and training applications, and games involving physical objects such as robot football and robotic car racing. Emphasis will also be placed on the use of these methods to improve performance in, and understanding of, the dynamics of games, as well as gaining insight into the properties of the methods as applied to games. It will also include using games as a platform for building intelligent embedded agents for real-world applications. The journal builds on a scientific community that has already been active in recent years with the development of new conference series such as the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Games (CIG) and Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE), as well as special issues on games in journals such as the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. When setting up the journal, a decision was made to include both artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence (CI) in the title. AI seeks to simulate intelligent behavior in any way that can be programmed effectively. Some see the field of AI as being all-inclusive, while others argue that there is nothing artificial about real intelligence as exhibited by higher mammals.

884	Bit-error-rate analysis of UWB radio using BPSK modulation over inter-chip radio channels for wireless chip area networks	Zhiming Chen; Yue Ping Zhang; Ai Qun Hu; Tung-Sang Ng	Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20090526	Wireless chip area networks (WCAN) signify a new development in wireless communications, where wireless interconnections among different cores within a chip (intrachip) or among different chips within a module (inter-chip) can be realized. In this paper, we analyze bit-error rate (BER) of an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation over an inter-chip wireless radio channel. Specifically, a novel technique of dynamically shifting an integral window is proposed to reduce the effects of inter-symbol interference (ISI). BER expressions are analytically derived and verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, by including both thermal and switching noise as the dominant noise sources, it is found that a BER less than 10-6 is feasible for a link distance up to 252 mm at a data rate of up to 650 Mbps. Besides, the link margin analysis shows that a link margin of 28.22 dB could be obtained for the same distance and data rate.

885	Fabrication of WC matrix composite tool material and its cutting performance in machining titanium alloys	Yang, Fazhan; Meng, Guangyao; Zhao, Jun; Ai, Xing	Tsinghua Science and Technology	20120117	Titanium alloys are used widely for their high strength-to-weight ratio and good corrosion resistance characteristics. However, these alloys have been classified as 'difficult-to-machine' materials. In order to improve the cutting efficiency in machining the titanium alloys, a new we matrix composite tool material was prepared by hot pressing technology in this research. The cutting performance of the newly developed tool material in machining titanium alloy Ti6AI4V was investigated. The factors which influence the wear modes of the tool were investigated and the wear mechanisms were analyzed. Results show that the high temperature and mechanical friction are the main factors in the wear process. The wear mechanisms of the tool in machining titanium alloys are adhesion wear and abrasive wear.

The expansion chamber is designed to improve the fluidic stability and maintain the ideal lens shape for precise microscale optical measurement. The optical aberration is also eliminated by minimizing the diffusive broadening at the interfaces. The collimation and focusing capabilities of three liquid microlenses are demonstrated.

888	Tracking in Low Frame Rate Video: A Cascade Particle Filter with Discriminative Observers of Different Life Spans	Yuan Li; Haizhou Ai; Yamashita, T.; Shihong Lao; Kawade, M.	Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on	20080819	Tracking object in low frame rate video or with abrupt motion poses two main difficulties which most conventional tracking methods can hardly handle: 1) poor motion continuity and increased search space; 2) fast appearance variation of target and more background clutter due to increased search space. In this paper, we address the problem from a view which integrates conventional tracking and detection, and present a temporal probabilistic combination of discriminative observers of different lifespans. Each observer is learned from different ranges of samples, with different subsets of features, to achieve varying level of discriminative power at varying cost. An efficient fusion and temporal inference is then done by a cascade particle filter which consists of multiple stages of importance sampling. Experiments show significantly improved accuracy of the proposed approach in comparison with existing tracking methods, under the condition of low frame rate data and abrupt motion of both target and camera.

890	Exploring Alternative Software Architecture Designs: A Planning Perspective	Diaz-Pace, J.A.; Campo, M.R.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20080923	Software architecture designs give us blueprints to build systems, enabling key early decisions that can help us achieve a system's functional and quality-attribute requirements. Architectural decisions have far-reaching effects on development in terms of quality, time, and cost. Architects apply technical knowledge and experience to guide their decision making, choosing among multiple design solutions to find a reasonable balance of quality attributes such as performance, modifiability, or security. This is complex and time consuming because qualities can conflict and lead to trade-offs. A trade-off means that the improvement of one quality comes at the cost of degrading another for example, modifiability versus performance. The DesignBots framework supports architects in searching for design alternatives by capturing quality-attribute design concepts into a hierarchical, mixed-initiative planning model. Overall, this work reinforces the argument that Al-based tools can facilitate the design of architectures driven by quality-attribute issues.

891	A Coded Modulation Scheme for Deep-Space Optical Communications	Ying Tan; Jian-Zhong Guo; Yong Ai; Wei Liu; Yu-Jie Fei	Photonics Technology Letters, IEEE	20080208	A coded modulation scheme for deep-space optical communications is studied, which is a serial concatenation of an outer low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, an interleaver, a bit-accumulator, and pulse-position modulation (PPM). It is referred as LDPC-APPM. It is decoded with an iterative demodulator-decoder using standard turbo-decoding techniques. Simulation results show that the LDPC-APPM with an outer LDPC code of medium code length suffers a loss of about 0.7 dB at a bit-error rate of relative to the serially concatenated PPM (SCPPM) of similar parameters, which consists of the serial concatenation of an outer convolutional code, an interleaver, a bit-accumulator, and PPM; however, it has better code rate flexibility especially for high rates and simpler implementation structure than SCPPM. Further, it can achieve better performance than the LDPC-PPM of the same rate and length, which consists of the serial concatenation of an LDPC code and PPM.

895	Calculation of Minimum Parameters Required for Low-Field Low-Size Nano Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NanoNMR)	Gomez, P.; Litvinov, D.; Khizroev, S.	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20081216	The objective of this research is to calculate the minimum parameters required to make low-field low-size nano nuclear magnetic resonance (NanoNMR) a viable technology and potentially one of the future lab-on-chip technologies. By low field we signify an externally applied magnetic field of less than 0.5 T, and by low size we mean a magnet whose largest physical dimension does not exceed 25 mm. The goal is to develop small and cost-effective NMR spectrometers that can be used at room temperature in a small office environment. In this paper, tunneling magneto resistance (TMR) devices are used to sense the NMR signal. The parameters that are calculated are: minimum sample size and concentration required to obtain an adequate NMR signal, TMR sensor size, and its distance to the sample, RF coil size, RF frequency, and power. The nanoscale TMR sensors proposed in this paper were designed using an in-house developed software tool. The optimally calculated TMR sensors have Fe50 Co50 PL and FL layers, an area of 100 nm times 100 nm, a 0.3-nm-thick AI2O3 barrier and is biased at 200 mV.

A wide range of Al concentration was investigated, and an optimum value was obtained. Based on the optimum Al concentration, arsenic- segregated NiSi2-xAlx (As-segregated NiSi2-xAlx) contacts were shown to achieve conduction band-edge Schottky-barrier heights with PhiB n = 0.133 eV. This novel As-segregated NiSi2-xAlx contact was integrated in FinFETs with a gate length of 80 nm and a fin width (WFin) of 11 nm, demonstrating improvement in current drivability of 30% over FinFETs with As-segregated NiSi contacts. We show that these ultranarrow fins (WFin = 11 nm) can be fully silicided reliably with NiSi2-xAlx, demonstrating scalability and the smallest fully silicided Si fins reported to date. For these ultra-narrow Si fins, we have successfully alleviated the concerns of parasitic series resistance without the use of selective epitaxial raised source and drain technology.

Yb3+ acting as bridging ion increases the energy transfer efficiency from Nd3+ 4F3/2 level to Ho3+ in these triply doped systems. The nonradiative energy transfer efficiency from Nd3+ 4F3/2 to Yd3+ 2F5/2 level can reach to 56%. The UC emission mechanisms are proposed based on spectral, kinetic, and pump power dependence analyses. The green UC emission is accomplished through a multi-ion interaction involving ground state absorption by the Nd3+ (4I9/2?2H9/2,4F5/2) followed by three successive energy transfer processes involving one Nd3+-Yb3+ (4F3/2+2F7/2?4I9/2+2F5/2) and two Yb3+-Ho3+ pairs (2F5/2+5I8?2F7/2+5I6 and 2F- 5/2+5I6?2F7/2+5S2,5F4); whereas the red is dominated by excited state absorption of the Ho3+ (5I7?5F5) following two successive energy transfer processes involving the Nd3+-Yb3+ (4F3/2+2F7/2?4I9/2+2F5/2) and Yb3+-Ho3+ pairs (2F5/2+5I8?2F7/2+5I6) followed by the Ho3+ nonradiative relaxation to 5I7.	excited states;ground states;holmium;impurity absorption spectra;infrared spectra;laser beam effects;lithium compounds;neodymium;optical pumping;photoluminescence;visible spectra;ytterbium6180Ba;7830Hv;7840Ha;7855Hx,

902	Silica-/titania-coated Y2O3:Tm3+, Yb3+ nanoparticles with improvement in upconversion luminescence induced by different thickness shells	Lu, Qiang; Guo, Fengyun; Liang Sun; Li, Aihua; Zhao, Liancheng	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	In order to improve the upconversion (UC) luminescence of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (NPs), different sized Y2O3:Tm3+, Yb3+ NPs were synthesized using the Pechini type sol-gel method, and their surfaces were coated with different thickness of SiO2 or TiO2 shells using the St�ber method. The results indicate that large-sized NPs have more intense UC luminescence intensities than small-sized NPs. The core-shell structures can enhance the UC luminescence intensities. Comparing with the UC luminescence intensity of noncoated NPs, the UC luminescence intensities of SiO2-coated NPs for the sintering time of 60 min and the coating time of 30, 60, 90, and 120 min are enhanced by 1.53, 1.54, 1.40, and 1.16 times, respectively. According to the relative variable ratios of the UC luminescence intensities, a competition process between two mechanisms was proposed to explain the effects of different thickness shells and different shell materials on the UC luminescence intensities. One mechanism is the role conversion of lanthanide ions on the NPs� surfaces, which is from the �dormant� state to the �activated� state due to the complementary ligand fields from noncrystalline SiO2 shells. The other is the absorption effects of the shells on the incident pump light and the reabsorption effects of the shells on the UC luminescence. Therefore, it can be concluded that more intense UC luminescence can be achieved in doped core-shell NPs by selecting the appropriate shell materials and their thickness.	coatings;doping;nanoparticles;photoluminescence;silicon compounds;sintering;sol-gel processing;thulium;titanium compounds;ytterbium;yttrium compounds6172up;6855J-;7855Hx;7867Bf;8107Bc;8120Fw,							
903	Population-Based Intelligent Search in Reliability Evaluation of Generation Systems With Wind Power Penetration	Lingfeng Wang; Singh, C.	Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20080725	Adequacy assessment of power-generating systems provides a mechanism to ensure proper system operations in the face of various uncertainties including equipment failures. The integration of time-dependent sources such as wind turbine generators (WTGs) makes the reliability evaluation process more challenging. Due to the large number of system states involved in system operations, it is normally not feasible to enumerate all possible failure states to calculate the reliability indices. Monte Carlo simulation can be used for this purpose through iterative selection and evaluation of system states. However, due to its dependence on proportionate sampling, its efficiency in locating failure states may be low. The simulation may thus be time-consuming and take a long time to converge in some evaluation scenarios. In this paper, as an alternative option, four representative population-based intelligent search (PIS) procedures including genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial immune system (AIS), and ant colony system (ACS) are adopted to search the meaningful system states through their inherent convergence mechanisms. These most probable failure states contribute most significantly to the adequacy indices including loss of load expectation (LOLE), loss of load frequency (LOLF), and expected energy not supplied (EENS). The proposed solution methodology is also compared with the Monte Carlo simulation through conceptual analyses and numerical simulations. In this way, some qualitative and quantitative comparisons are conducted. A modified IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE-RTS) is used in this investigation.

904	On forced and subharmonic oscillations under relay feedback	Lim, L.H.; Loh, A.P.; Tan, W.W.	Control Theory & Applications, IET	20080826	The necessary and sufficient conditions for forced and subharmonic oscillations (FO and SO, respectively) in an externally driven single-loop relay feedback system (RFS) are analysed. It is shown that FO of any frequency will always occur in the RFS if and only if the amplitude of the external forcing signal is larger than some minimum. This minimum amplitude can be determined by graphical/numerical approaches. In contrast, the existence of SO is dependent on both the amplitude and frequency of the external signal. Interestingly, one may not be able to obtain any SO for arbitrary frequencies even if the amplitude of the external signal is large. Given this important fundamental difference, the study also sets out to determine the range of frequencies where SO can exists, along with the necessary minimum amplitude of the external signal required for the SO to occur. Simulation studies are given to illustrate the results of the analysis.	control system analysis;feedback;harmonic oscillators;numerical analysis;relay controlarbitrary frequency;external forcing signal;forced oscillations;necessary and sufficient conditions;single-loop relay feedback system;subharmonic oscillations

The test involves flying magnetic recording heads over custom-made asperities on the surface of a hard disk. Degradation of the read sensor amplitude, asymmetry, magnetic stability, pinned-layer flip, overwrite, and resistance were observed. The changes are attributed to stress induced magnetic anisotropy and/or scratching/smearing damage. Testing comparison of a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) and a tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) head design showed that the TMR design was more susceptible to abrupt resistance decrease and amplitude loss, consistent with scratching/smearing damage at the air bearing surface.

909	A Double-Deck Elevator Group Supervisory Control System Using Genetic Network Programming	Hirasawa, K.; Eguchi, T.; Jin Zhou; Lu Yu; Jinglu Hu; Markon, S.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on	20080620	Elevator group supervisory control systems (EGSCSs) are designed so that the movement of several elevators in a building is controlled efficiently. The efficient control of EGSCSs using conventional control methods is very difficult due to its complexity, so it is becoming popular to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into EGSCSs in recent years. As a new approach, a graph-based evolutionary method named genetic network programming (GNP) has been applied to the EGSCSs, and its effectiveness is clarified. The GNP can introduce various a priori knowledge of the EGSCSs in its node functions easily, and can execute an efficient rule-based group supervisory control that is optimized in an evolutionary way. Meanwhile, double-deck elevator systems (DDESs) where two cages are connected in a shaft have been developed for the rising demand of more efficient transport of passengers in high-rise buildings. The DDESs have specific features due to the connection of cages and the need for comfortable riding; so its group supervisory control becomes more complex and requires more efficient group control systems than the conventional single-deck elevator systems (SDESs). In this paper, a new group supervisory control system for DDESs using GNP is proposed, and its optimization and performance evaluation are done through simulations. First, optimization of the GNP for DDSEs is executed. Second, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparison with conventional methods, and the obtained control rules in GNP are studied. Finally, the reduction of space requirements compared with SDESs is confirmed.

911	Optimality and Complexity of Pure Nash Equilibria in the Coverage Game	Xin Ai; Srinivasan, V.; Chen-Khong Tham	Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on	20080822	"In this paper, we investigate the coverage problem in wireless sensor networks using a game theory method. We assume that nodes are randomly scattered in a sensor field and the goal is to partition these nodes into K sets. At any given time, nodes belonging to only one of these sets actively sense the field. A key challenge is to achieve this partition in a distributed manner with purely local information and yet provide near optimal coverage. We appropriately formulate this coverage problem as a coverage game and prove that the optimal solution is a pure Nash equilibrium. Then, we design synchronous and asynchronous algorithms, which converge to pure Nash equilibria. Moreover, we analyze the optimality and complexity of pure Nash equilibria in the coverage game. We prove that, the ratio between the optimal coverage and the worst case Nash equilibrium coverage, is upper bounded by 2 - 1/m+1 (m is the maximum number of nodes, which cover any point, in the Nash equilibrium solution s*). We prove that finding pure Nash equilibria in the general coverage game is PLS-complete, i.e. ""as hard as that of finding a local optimum in any local search problem with efficient computable neighbors"". Finally, via extensive simulations, we show that, the Nash equilibria coverage performance is very close to the optimal coverage and the convergence speed is sublinear. Even under the noisy environment, our algorithms can still converge to the pure Nash equilibria."

915	RM-MEDA: A Regularity Model-Based Multiobjective Estimation of Distribution Algorithm	Qingfu Zhang; Aimin Zhou; Yaochu Jin	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20080131	Under mild conditions, it can be induced from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition that the Pareto set, in the decision space, of a continuous multiobjective optimization problem is a piecewise continuous (m - 1)-D manifold, where m is the number of objectives. Based on this regularity property, we propose a regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) for continuous multiobjective optimization problems with variable linkages. At each generation, the proposed algorithm models a promising area in the decision space by a probability distribution whose centroid is a (m - 1)-D piecewise continuous manifold. The local principal component analysis algorithm is used for building such a model. New trial solutions are sampled from the model thus built. A nondominated sorting-based selection is used for choosing solutions for the next generation. Systematic experiments have shown that, overall, RM-MEDA outperforms three other state-of-the-art algorithms, namely, GDE3, PCX-NSGA-II, and MIDEA, on a set of test instances with variable linkages. We have demonstrated that, compared with GDE3, RM-MEDA is not sensitive to algorithmic parameters, and has good scalability to the number of decision variables in the case of nonlinear variable linkages. A few shortcomings of RM-MEDA have also been identified and discussed in this paper.

Most are for bomb disposal but some are armed. In addition to the robots, semi-autonomous unmanned air vehicles come equipped with hellfire missiles. For now, all these systems employ a human-in-the-loop for the application of lethal force. But this is set to change. In the near- to mid-term future, the military might allow autonomous unmanned systems to make their own lethality decisions.

918	Representation Discovery using Harmonic Analysis		Representation Discovery using Harmonic Analysis	20140702	Representations are at the heart of artificial intelligence (AI). This book is devoted to the problem of representation discovery: how can an intelligent system construct representations from its experience? Representation discovery re-parameterizes the state space - prior to the application of information retrieval, machine learning, or optimization techniques - facilitating later inference processes by constructing new task-specific bases adapted to the state space geometry. This book presents a general approach to representation discovery using the framework of harmonic analysis, in particular Fourier and wavelet analysis. Biometric compression methods, the compact disc, the computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanner in medicine, JPEG compression, and spectral analysis of time-series data are among the many applications of classical Fourier and wavelet analysis. A central goal of this book is to show that these analytical tools can be generalized from their usual setting in (infin te-dimensional) Euclidean spaces to discrete (finite-dimensional) spaces typically studied in many subfields of AI. Generalizing harmonic analysis to discrete spaces poses many challenges: a discrete representation of the space must be adaptively acquired; basis functions are not pre-defined, but rather must be constructed. Algorithms for efficiently computing and representing bases require dealing with the curse of dimensionality. However, the benefits can outweigh the costs, since the extracted basis functions outperform parametric bases as they often reflect the irregular shape of a particular state space. Case studies from computer graphics, information retrieval, machine learning, and state space planning are used to illustrate the benefits of the proposed framework, and the challenges that remain to be addressed. Representation discovery is an actively developing field, and the author hopes this book will encourage other researchers to explore this exciting area of research.

919	Analyses of the work required to delaminate a coating film from a substrate under oscillating load conditions and the film-substrate contact behavior after delamination	Liou, Jeng Luen; Pal Jen Wei; Liang, Wen Long; Ai, Chi Fong; Jen Fin Lin	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Nanoindentation tests in which oscillating loads were applied to specimens were carried out to study the work (Wf) required for a coating film to delaminate from its substrate. A sharp increase in the indentation depth occurred during coating film delamination. A theoretical model was developed for the present study to evaluate the difference between the work in the load-depth profiles obtained with and without delamination. Arranging that the maximum load was reached at the end of the loading process allowed us to obtain an approximately constant value for the indentation depth propagation rate during in one cycle. This allowed a determination of the number of oscillating cycles and, thus, the work required by assuming that there was no delamination during this delamination period. The depth propagation rates and the work required for coating film delamination were investigated by varying Pmax, Pmean, P0, and frequency (f). The depth propagation rates were slightly increased by increasing the Pmax value but were significantly lowered by increasing the frequency (f). The effects due to the changes in Pmean and P0 on the depth propagation rate were insignificant. The Wf value was slightly lowered by increasing the Pmax value but was significantly increased by increasing the oscillating load frequency (f). The effects of varying P0 and Pmean on the Wf value were found to be small. The Wf values showed an exponential drop when the depth propa- gation rate was increased; they were asymptotic to a constant value when the depth propagation rate was sufficiently high. Coating film delamination produced a sharp increase in the indentation depth even in the case of a very small load increase. The oscillating load-depth cycles appearing after delamination allowed us to establish the film-substrate contact behavior occurring during the loading/unloading process of one oscillating cycle.	coatings;delamination;indentation;nanostructured materials6220M-;6225-g;8107Bc;8140Np,							
920	Effective Web Service Composition in Diverse and Large-Scale Service Networks	Seog-Chan Oh; Lee, D.; Kumara, S.R.T.	Services Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20090113	The main research focus of Web services is to achieve the interoperability between distributed and heterogeneous applications. Therefore, flexible composition of Web services to fulfill the given challenging requirements is one of the most important objectives in this research field. However, until now, service composition has been largely an error-prone and tedious process. Furthermore, as the number of available web services increases, finding the right Web services to satisfy the given goal becomes intractable. In this paper, toward these issues, we propose an AI planning-based framework that enables the automatic composition of Web services, and explore the following issues. First, we formulate the Web-service composition problem in terms of AI planning and network optimization problems to investigate its complexity in detail. Second, we analyze publicly available Web service sets using network analysis techniques. Third, we develop a novel Web-service benchmark tool called WSBen. Fourth, we develop a novel AI planning-based heuristic Web-service composition algorithm named WSPR. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to verify WSPR against state-of-the-art AI planners. It is our hope that both WSPR and WSBen will provide useful insights for researchers to develop Web-service discovery and composition algorithms, and software.

As they become more mature, most industries spawn specialized sub-industries. For example, automobile manufacturers don't make their own tires, and aircraft manufacturers don't even make their own jet engines. By aiming to amortize their costs over a wider customer base, specialized companies can devote the required resources to research and development.

923	Polarization offset of homogeneous Bi3.15Nd0.85Ti3O12 ferroelectric thin films	Wu, Hao; Wu, Di; Li, Aidong	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	In this report, the polarization offset usually observed in compositionally graded ferroelectric thin films was observed in homogeneous Bi3.15Nd0.85Ti3O12 thin films sandwiched in Pt electrodes. The observed polarization offset was studied as functions of temperature and of the driving voltage amplitude using a modified SawyerﾖTower circuit. The polarization offset is obvious only at temperatures above 150 ﾰC and increases with increasing testing temperature and amplitude of driving voltage. The reported phenomena demonstrate that the composition gradient is not a necessity for such a polarization offset. The strong temperature and voltage dependence indicates that the polarization offsets may be related to thermionic charge injection, which is asymmetric to top and bottom electrodes.	bismuth compounds;dielectric polarisation;ferroelectric thin films;neodymium compounds7722Ej;7780Dj;7784Dy,

Broadcasting, IEEE Transactions on	20080822	A new metric for assessing spatial quality of the temporally interpolated frames is proposed. It is designed to overcome disadvantages found in several widely used metrics for the frame interpolation application. The proposed metric quantifies the severities of several pronounced interpolation artifacts and combines them along with human visual factors to form a global (i.e. frame-wide) quality measurement. Also, the artifact amounts are used to determine additional quality impairment caused by locally aggregated distortion. Finally, these two measurements are combined into a single quality score. Subjective experiments show that the proposed metric significantly outperforms other commonly used metrics.

928	Higher Level Application of ADP: A Next Phase for the Control Field?	Lendaris, G.G.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20080716	Two distinguishing features of humanlike control vis-a-vis current technological control are the ability to make use of experience while selecting a control policy for distinct situations and the ability to do so faster and faster as more experience is gained (in contrast to current technological implementations that slow down as more knowledge is stored). The notions of context and context discernment are important to understanding this human ability. Whereas methods known as adaptive control and learning control focus on modifying the design of a controller as changes in context occur, experience-based (EB) control entails selecting a previously designed controller that is appropriate to the current situation. Developing the EB approach entails a shift of the technologist's focus ldquoup a levelrdquo away from designing individual (optimal) controllers to that of developing online algorithms that efficiently and effectively select designs from a repository of existing controller solutions. A key component of the notions presented here is that of higher level learning algorithm. This is a new application of reinforcement learning and, in particular, approximate dynamic programming, with its focus shifted to the posited higher level, and is employed, with very promising results. The author's hope for this paper is to inspire and guide future work in this promising area.

929	Explicit general solution to the matrix equation AV 1 BW 5 EVF 1 R	Wu, A.-G.; Duan, G.-R.	Control Theory & Applications, IET	20080131	A matrix equation AV+BW = EVF + R is considered, where E, A, B and R are matrices with appropriate dimensions, F is an arbitrarily given Jordan matrix and V and W are the matrices to be determined. A complete explicit general solution for this equation is established based on elementary transformations of polynomial matrices. The proposed solution does not involve the derivative of polynomial matrices and not require the eigenvalues of matrix F to be known. When the eigenvalues of matrix F are prescribed, the solution for matrices V and W can be obtained by carrying out singular value decompositions, thus possesses good numerical stability. An example is employed to illustrate the effect of the proposed approaches.	eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;numerical stability;polynomial matriceseigenvalues;explicit general solution;matrix equation;numerical stability;polynomial matrices							
930	Invariant Manifold Based Reduced-Order Observer Design for Nonlinear Systems	Karagiannis, D.; Carnevale, D.; Astolfi, A.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20081222	The problem of constructing globally convergent, reduced-order observers for general nonlinear systems is addressed. It is shown that an asymptotic estimate of the unknown states can be obtained by rendering attractive an appropriately selected (invariant) manifold in the extended state space. Current results on nonlinear observer design require that the nonlinearities appearing in the system equations are either linear functions of the unmeasured states or monotonic functions of a linear combination of the states. In this paper we relax these two assumptions by allowing for a wider class of nonlinearities to appear in the system equations. The proposed approach is applied on several examples including a perspective vision system and a general two-degrees-of-freedom mechanical system.

931	Influence of Resistance of Electric Arc on Transients Due to Disconnector Switching in Air-Insulated Substations	Carsimamovic, S.; Bajramovic, Z.; Veledar, M.; Ljevak, M.; Carsimamovic, A.; Osmokrovic, P.	Plasma Science, IEEE Transactions on	20081117	In this paper, switching overvoltages due to disconnector switching in air-insulated substations (AISs) are presented. Measurements of these switching overvoltages were performed in the AIS Grabovica (Hydro Power Plant-HPP Grabovica) on River Neretva and the AIS Kakanj (Thermo Power Plant-TPP Kakanj). These power plants are important objects for operation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's electric power system. Investigations of operating of air-disconnector-type centre break was performed in order to determine switching-overvoltage levels on primary and secondary circuits that can lead to relay tripping in AIS Grabovica and AIS Kakanj. During operations of disconnector (synchronization or disconnecting of generator from network), malfunctions of signaling devices and burning of supply units of protection relays appeared. At the same time, sparking between primary terminals of the instrument current transformer occurred. The influence of resistance of electric arc between the contacts of the disconnector is analyzed. Computer simulations by means of alternative transients program-electromagnetic transients program are performed. Differences between the measured and the calculated values were under 4.52% for overvoltage factor and under 2.56% for overvoltage wave frequency. Comparison of the transient computer simulations with the field measurements showed that calculations could be used for the assessment of the transient overvoltages caused by disconnector switching.

Pervasive Computing, IEEE	20081017	User-generated services (UGSs) are the next step in the user-generated content (UGC) trend. UGSs let end users create their own personalized services using simple graphical tools, such as Microsoft Popfly or Yahoo Pipes. This work aims to design a system to automate the requirement identification and service discovery task for UGSs.

933	Mining Appearance Models Directly From Compressed Video	Datong Chen; Qiang Liu; Mingui Sun; Jie Yang	Multimedia, IEEE Transactions on	20080116	In this paper, we propose an approach for learning appearance models of moving objects directly from compressed video. The appearance of a moving object changes dynamically in video due to varying object poses, lighting conditions, and partial occlusions. Efficiently mining the appearance models of objects is a crucial and challenging technology to support content-based video coding, clustering, indexing, and retrieval at the object level. The proposed approach learns the appearance models of moving objects in the spatial-temporal dimension of video data by taking advantage of the MPEG video compression format. It detects a moving object and recovers the trajectory of each macroblock covered by the object using the motion vector present in the compressed stream. The appearances are then reconstructed in the DCT domain along the object's trajectory, and modeled as a mixture of Gaussians (MoG) using DCT coefficients. We prove that, under certain assumptions, the MoG model learned from the DCT domain can achieve pixel-level accuracy when transformed back to the spatial domain, and has a better band-selectivity compared to the MoG model learned in the spatial domain. We finally cluster the MoG models to merge the appearance models of the same object together for object-level content analysis.

934	Stability Analysis of the Continuous-Conduction-Mode Buck Converter Via Filippov's Method	Giaouris, D.; Banerjee, S.; Zahawi, B.; Pickert, Volker	Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, IEEE Transactions on	20080512	To study the stability of a nominal cyclic steady state in power electronic converters, it is necessary to obtain a linearization around the periodic orbit. In many past studies, this was achieved by explicitly deriving the Poincare map that describes the evolution of the state from one clock instant to the next and then locally linearizing the map at the fixed point. However, in many converters, the map cannot be derived in closed form, and therefore this approach cannot directly be applied. Alternatively, the orbital stability can be worked out by studying the evolution of perturbations about a nominal periodic orbit, and some studies along this line have also been reported. In this paper, we show that Filippov's method - which has commonly been applied to mechanical switching systems - can be used fruitfully in power electronic circuits to achieve the same end by describing the behavior of the system during the switchings. By combining this and the Floquet theory, it is possible to describe the stability of power electronic converters. We demonstrate the method using the example of a voltage-mode-controlled buck converter operating in continuous conduction mode. We find that the stability of a converter is strongly dependent upon the so-called saltation matrix - the state transition matrix relating the state just after the switching to that just before. We show that the Filippov approach, especially the structure of the saltation matrix, offers some additional insights on issues related to the stability of the orbit, like the recent observation that coupling with spurious signals coming from the environment causes intermittent subharmonic windows. Based on this approach, we also propose a new controller that can significantly extend the parameter range for nominal period-1 operation.

935	Flexible Polymer Sensors for In Vivo Intravascular Shear Stress Analysis	Hongyu Yu; Lisong Ai; Rouhanizadeh, Mahsa; Patel, D.; Eun Sok Kim; Hsiai, T.K.	Microelectromechanical Systems, Journal of	20080930	Hemodynamic forces, specifically fluid shear stress, play an important role in the focal nature of arterial plaque formation known as atherosclerosis. We hereby developed biocompatible and flexible intravascular microelectromechanical systems sensor to measure real-time shear stress in the aortas of New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits. Titanium (Ti) and platinum (Pt) were deposited on silicon wafers and patterned to form the sensing elements. The polymer, parylene C, provided insulation to the electrode leads and flexibility to the sensors. Based on heat transfer principle, the heat dissipation from the sensors to the blood flow altered the resistance of the sensing elements, from which shear stress was calibrated. The resistance of the sensing element was measured at approximately 1.0 kOmega , and the temperature coefficient of resistance was at approximately 0.16%/degC. The individual sensors were packaged to the catheter for intravascular deployment in the aortas of NZW rabbits (n = 5) . The sensor was capable of resolving spatial- and time-varying components of shear stress in the abdominal aorta. Computational fluid dynamic code based on non-Newtonian fluid properties showed comparable results within an acceptable range of experimental errors ( plusmn9%) for the maximal and minimal values in shear stress during one cardiac cycle. Therefore, we demonstrated the capability of biocompatible sensors for real-time shear stress measurement in vivo with a potential to advance the understanding between the blood flow and vascular disease.

936	Index		How to Build a Person:A Prolegomenon	20120924	"Building a person has been an elusive goal in artificial intelligence. This failure, John Pollock argues, is because the problems involved are essentially philosophical; what is needed for the construction of a person is a physical system that mimics human rationality. Pollock describes an exciting theory of rationality and its partial implementation in OSCAR, a computer system whose descendants will literally be persons.In developing the philosophical superstructure for this bold undertaking, Pollock defends the conception of man as an intelligent machine and argues that mental states are physical states and persons are physical objects as described in the fable of Oscar, the self conscious machine.Pollock brings a unique blend of philosophy and artificial intelligence to bear on the vexing problem of how to construct a physical system that thinks, is self conscious, has desires, fears, intentions, and a full range of mental states. He brings together an impressive array of technical work in philosophy to drive theory construction in AI.

We show that graded BNdT films may exhibit no offsets at room temperature and both graded and nongraded BNdT films exhibit pronounced offsets at elevated temperatures. The offset does not have a direct relation with the composition gradient but increases as the maximum voltage is increased. It is verified that the offset increases with the increase in asymmetry of leakage currents at positive and negative biases.	bismuth compounds;dielectric hysteresis;dielectric polarisation;ferroelectric thin films7722Ej;7755+f;7780Dj;7784Dy,

943	Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of the torsional mode for two acoustic viscometers with preliminary experimental tests	Yuhui Ai; Lange, R.A.	Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, IEEE Transactions on	20080331	A rigorous analysis of the torsional modes in both a cylindrical wave guide and the associated static viscous fluid field has been conducted from the solid and the fluid wave equations and the coupled boundary conditions. As a result, two acoustic viscometer models, along with four independent equations connecting the density and the viscosity of the fluid with the attenuation and the phase velocity of the torsional wave in the wave guide, have been developed. The analysis shows that the product of the viscosity and the density of the fluid can be measured from the end reflection coefficient of the torsional wave in the wave guide and that both the viscosity and the density can be determined simultaneously from either the phase velocity or the attenuation of the torsional wave in a single cylindrical wave guide. For the simultaneous measurements of the viscosity and the density, the independent equations have to be solved numerically, for example, using Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA), given either the attenuation or the phase velocity in the wave guide that is surrounded by the fluid. To demonstrate the technical feasibility, numerical simulations have been conducted to discern viscosity, phase velocity, and density, all versus attenuation, at different frequencies, and with variable dimension of a molybdenum rod, so that both the advantages and the disadvantages of the simultaneous measurements can be explored. In the end, to test the two models, preliminary experiments on two viscous standards were conducted at 23degC, and good agreements have been achieved between the viscosities measured from both models and for both standards.	,Acoustic testing;Attenuation measurement;Density measurement;Equations;Mathematical model;Measurement standards;Numerical simulation;Phase measurement;Velocity measurement;Viscosity,acoustic waveguides;viscometersacoustic viscometers;associated static viscous fluid;coupled boundary conditions;end reflection coefficient;fluid wave equations;molybdenum rod;phase velocity;single cylindrical wave guide;temperature 23 degC;torsional wave attenuation;viscosity							
944	Nonlinear Dynamic Compensation of Sensors Using Inverse-Model-Based Neural Network	Dongchuan Yu; Fang Liu; Pik-Yin Lai; Aiguo Wu	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20080912	Many sensors (such as low-cost sensors), in essence, display strongly nonlinear dynamic behavior that cannot be calibrated by well-developed linear dynamic compensation methods. So far, no general nonlinear dynamic compensation (NLDC) method exists, although there are some approaches based on nonlinear models (including Volterra series expansion, Wiener kernels, the Hammerstein model, and finite impulse response) that were developed to compensate some special kinds of nonlinear sensors. In this paper, we suggest a general framework for NLDC, in which removal of the influence of disturbance by using an auxiliary sensor is significantly studied and presented. The inverse model and differential-estimation-filter arrays are embedded in this general framework, where a neural network is applied to approximate the inverse mapping, and differential-filter arrays are used to estimate signal differentials up to a certain order. We also discuss the existence conditions of the general framework. The detailed design procedure of this general method is given as well. Simulation and experiments are presented to illustrate the proposed general NLDC method.

946	RTD Response Time Estimation in the Presence of Temperature Variations and Its Application to Semiconductor Manufacturing	Tan, W.W.; Li, R.F.Y.; Ai Poh Loh; Weng Khuen Ho	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20080107	Good control of wafer temperature during the postexposure bake (PEB) process is gaining importance. Although negative feedback techniques can improve temperature control, poor thermal contact between the sensor and the wafer will cause the feedback signal quality and the performance of the closed-loop system to deteriorate. A plausible solution is to predict the wafer temperature using the inverse sensor model constructed via data from a loop current step response (LCSR) test. However, the LCSR test must be completed before the PEB process can commence, resulting in a loss in wafer throughput. In this paper, a sensor parameter estimation algorithm is proposed to enable the LCSR test and the PEB process to be concurrently performed. Simulation results demonstrated that the sensor parameters can be reasonably accurately estimated, provided that the start of the PEB process coincided exactly with the instant at which the resistance temperature detector current is switched from a high value (self-heating mode) back to its nominal value (sensing mode). As this condition is not practical, a workaround is proposed to enable the accurate identification of sensor parameters in practice. Finally, experimental results are presented. They demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to identify the sensor parameters. Consequently, consistent control performance can be achieved, regardless of the level of thermal contact between sensor and wafer.

947	An Artificial Immune System Heuristic for Generating Short Addition Chains	Cruz-Corte&#x0301;s, N.; Rodriguez-Henriquez, F.; Coello Coello, C.A.	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20080131	This paper deals with the optimal computation of finite field exponentiation, which is a well-studied problem with many important applications in the areas of error-correcting codes and cryptography. It has been shown that the optimal computation of finite field exponentiation is a problem which is closely related to finding a suitable addition chain with the shortest possible length. However, it is also known that obtaining the shortest addition chain for a given arbitrary exponent is an NP-hard problem. As a consequence, heuristics are an obvious choice to compute field exponentiation with a semi-optimal number of underlying arithmetic operations. In this paper, we propose the use of an artificial immune system to tackle this problem. Particularly, we study the problem of finding both the shortest addition chains for exponents e with moderate size (i.e., with a length of less than 20 bits), and for the huge exponents typically adopted in cryptographic applications, (i.e., in the range from 128 to 2048 bits).

In addition, TC enhancement was also observed in the nanobelts. The results suggest that the single-crystal Pb nanobelts prepared on Si semiconductor substrate offer a great opportunity for integrating superconducting circuits in a single Si chip.	lead;magnetoresistance;nanostructured materials;superconducting thin films;superconducting transition temperature7410+v;7425Fy;7478Na,							
950	A Modified Backpropagation Learning Algorithm With Added Emotional Coefficients	Khashman, A.	Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on	20081105	Much of the research work into artificial intelligence (AI) has been focusing on exploring various potential applications of intelligent systems with successful results in most cases. In our attempts to model human intelligence by mimicking the brain structure and function, we overlook an important aspect in human learning and decision making: the emotional factor. While it currently sounds impossible to have ldquomachines with emotions,rdquo it is quite conceivable to artificially simulate some emotions in machine learning. This paper presents a modified backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm, namely, the emotional backpropagation (EmBP) learning algorithm. The new algorithm has additional emotional weights that are updated using two additional emotional parameters: anxiety and confidence. The proposed ldquoemotionalrdquo neural network will be implemented to a facial recognition problem, and the results will be compared to a similar application using a conventional neural network. Experimental results show that the addition of the two novel emotional parameters improves the performance of the neural network yielding higher recognition rates and faster recognition time.

Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on	20080408	In this paper, a novel, low-complexity motion vector processing algorithm at the decoder is proposed for motion-compensated frame interpolation or frame rate up-conversion. We address the problems of having broken edges and deformed structures in an interpolated frame by hierarchically refining motion vectors on different block sizes. Our method explicitly considers the reliability of each received motion vector and has the capability of preserving the structure information. This is achieved by analyzing the distribution of residual energies and effectively merging blocks that have unreliable motion vectors. The motion vector reliability information is also used as a prior knowledge in motion vector refinement using a constrained vector median filter to avoid choosing identical unreliable one. We also propose using chrominance information in our method. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has better visual quality and is also robust, even in video sequences with complex scenes and fast motion.

958	Asymmetric Tuning Schemes of MEMS Dual-Shutter VOA	Zhang, X.M.; Zhao, Q.W.; Liu, A.Q.; Zhang, J.; Lau, J.H.; Kam, C.H.	Lightwave Technology, Journal of	20080408	A dual-shutter MEMS variable optical attenuator (VOA) is designed for advanced tuning functions such as linear attenuation relationship and simultaneous coarse and fine tunings. The mechanism behind is to take advantage of the additional shutter to render one more degree of freedom for attenuation adjustment. Although dual-shutter VOAs with asymmetric functionalities have been reported before, these intrinsic capabilities owing to asymmetry have not been extensively investigated. In experiment, the fabricated VOA device has demonstrated a linear tuning over a 20-dB range with respect to the driving voltage of one shutter, and it has also realized simultaneously coarse tuning (2.5 dB/V) and fine tuning (0.1 dB/V) by the two shutters. Ideally, the tuning can start from any available working point, linear to any controlling parameter, at any slope of linearity, and with any tuning resolution. Theoretical attenuation model has also been developed to provide a roadmap for the VOA design and choice of working point. An interesting finding is that over a certain range the linear attenuation can be obtained by moving a fixed aperture rather than by reducing the aperture size, which greatly relaxes the difficulty of shutter position control. The measured results match well with the theoretical data, implying the possibility of developing a look-up table to locate the shutter positions quickly. The dual-shutter VOA accomplishes these features without the need of high-precision control systems and therefore gives a structure-based rather than a control-system-based solution, clearly advantageous over the previously developed VOAs.

959	Handwritten-Word Spotting Using Biologically Inspired Features	van Der Zant, T.; Schomaker, L.; Haak, K.	Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on	20080919	For quick access to new handwritten collections, current handwriting recognition methods are too cumbersome. They cannot deal with the lack of labeled data and would require extensive laboratory training for each individual script, style, language, and collection. We propose a biologically inspired whole-word recognition method that is used to incrementally elicit word labels in a live Web-based annotation system, named Monk. Since human labor should be minimized given the massive amount of image data, it becomes important to rely on robust perceptual mechanisms in the machine. Recent computational models of the neurophysiology of vision are applied to isolated word classification. A primate cortex-like mechanism allows us to classify text images that have a low frequency of occurrence. Typically, these images are the most difficult to retrieve and often contain named entities and are regarded as the most important to people. Usually, standard pattern-recognition technology cannot deal with these text images if there are not enough labeled instances. The results of this retrieval system are compared to normalized word-image matching and appear to be very promising.

Applied Physics Letters	20090618	An evanescent wave sensor based on liquid waveguide is integrated onto a microfluidic chip. The structure of the liquid waveguide consists of three streams with two low refractive index fluids as cladding layers, which envelop a high refractive index fluid as a core layer along a microchannel. Light is coupled into the core layer, and a detected sample is injected into one cladding layer. The profile of the output light modal power is changed by varying the concentration of the sample. The sensor with a sensitivity of 275ﾠ?m2ﾠl/mol can be used for real-time, low-cost, and label-free measurements in a wide range of applications.	claddings;fibre optic sensors;micro-optomechanical devices;microfluidics;optical waveguides;refractive index4279Gn;4281Pa;4785Np;8585+j,							
962	An Innovative Method to Classify Remote-Sensing Images Using Ant Colony Optimization	Xiaoping Liu; Xia Li; Lin Liu; Jinqiang He; Bin Ai	Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20081209	This paper presents a new method to improve the classification performance for remote-sensing applications based on swarm intelligence. Traditional statistical classifiers have limitations in solving complex classification problems because of their strict assumptions. For example, data correlation between bands of remote-sensing imagery has caused problems in generating satisfactory classification using statistical methods. In this paper, ant colony optimization (ACO), based upon swarm intelligence, is used to improve the classification performance. Due to the positive feedback mechanism, ACO takes into account the correlation between attribute variables, thus avoiding issues related to band correlation. A discretization technique is incorporated in this ACO method so that classification rules can be induced from large data sets of remote-sensing images. Experiments of this ACO algorithm in the Guangzhou area reveal that it yields simpler rule sets and better accuracy than the See 5.0 decision tree method.

964	Light-Intensity-Feedback-Waveform Generator Based on MEMS Variable Optical Attenuator	Borovic, B.; Ai-Qun Liu; Popa, D.; Hong Cai; Lewis, F.L.	Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20080104	Increasing demands on the dynamical behavior of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices are reaching a point where mechanical design by itself cannot provide further improvements. Alternative approaches based on control theory, such as the open-loop or the closed-loop driving strategies, must be used instead to provide further enhancements in device performance. In this paper, the design of a light-intensity control system for an optical waveform generator is presented. The optical waveform generator is based on the light-modulation ability of MEMS variable optical attenuators (VOA). The VOA is of shutter-insertion type driven by an electrostatic comb drive. The control system consists of an inner position-control loop and an outer light-intensity-control loop. The inner control loop improves the dynamic response of the position of the MEMS electrostatic comb actuator by using position feedback, whereas the outer feedback loop handles both light-intensity regulation and tracking. An experimental setup and a practical system characterization are given. Based on this, the feedback control system is implemented on an actual MEMS VOA. The results verify that the control system proposed in this paper does significantly improve both the accuracy and the dynamical behavior of the existing device.

Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	We have performed both one-dimensional variational and two-dimensional numerical calculations of the magnetic curling structure near the ends of soft magnetic nanotubes whose axes are magnetically favored, and compared the two. The variational calculation is based on the observation that the numerical simulation results for ending curling structure are similar to those for head-to-head domain walls. Except for magnetic fields opposing the average magnetization and larger than a critical value, the wall centers are outside the tube, and there is an appreciable energy barrier against penetration of the tube by the wall. The two calculations are in reasonable agreement for a range of tube dimensions and material parameters. Both predict critical fields lower than those for infinite tubes.	magnetic anisotropy;magnetic domain walls;magnetic structure;nanotubes;nucleation;soft magnetic materials7540Mg;7560Ch;7575+a,

To this end, we divide the full-order model into two subsystems, one of which is modified to approximate the full-order model. We show that the suggested method drives the HIV patient state into the LTNP region of attraction. This article is organized as follows. First, the problem under consideration is formulated, and a description of the HIV infection model is provided. Then, measurement methods for the states of the HIV model are surveyed. Subsequently the HIV infection model is modified to yield a reduced-order model. Finally, two control strategies based on this modified model are presented along with simulation results.

974	Bibliography		How to Build a Person:A Prolegomenon	20120924	"Building a person has been an elusive goal in artificial intelligence. This failure, John Pollock argues, is because the problems involved are essentially philosophical; what is needed for the construction of a person is a physical system that mimics human rationality. Pollock describes an exciting theory of rationality and its partial implementation in OSCAR, a computer system whose descendants will literally be persons.In developing the philosophical superstructure for this bold undertaking, Pollock defends the conception of man as an intelligent machine and argues that mental states are physical states and persons are physical objects as described in the fable of Oscar, the self conscious machine.Pollock brings a unique blend of philosophy and artificial intelligence to bear on the vexing problem of how to construct a physical system that thinks, is self conscious, has desires, fears, intentions, and a full range of mental states. He brings together an impressive array of technical work in philosophy to drive theory construction in AI. The result is described in his final chapter on ""cognitive carpentry.""John Pollock is Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at the University of Arizona. A Bradford Book"								
975	An Adaptive GTS Allocation Scheme for IEEE 802.15.4	Yu-Kai Huang; Ai-Chun Pang; Hui-Nien Hung	Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20080331	IEEE 802.15.4 is a new standard uniquely designed for low-rate wireless personal area networks. It targets ultralow complexity, cost, and power for low-rate wireless connectivity among inexpensive, portable, and moving devices. IEEE 802.15.4 provides a guaranteed time slot (GTS) mechanism to allocate a specific duration within a superframe for time-critical transmissions. This paper proposes an adaptive GTS allocation (AGA) scheme for IEEE 802.15.4, which considers low latency and fairness. The scheme is designed based on the existing IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control protocol, and IEEE 802.15.4 devices can receive this AGA service without any modification. A simulation model and an analytical model are developed to investigate the performance of our AGA scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing IEEE 802.15.4 implementation.

977	The Creation Process of Chinese Calligraphy and Emulation of Imagery Thinking	Jun Dong; Miao Xu; Xian-jun Zhang; Yan-qing Gao; Yun-He Pan	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20090109	Chinese calligraphy is both an art form and the embodiment of imagery thinking. The process of calligraphy involves studying tablets or documents, remembering the contents, and creating new artwork with calligraphic images from memory. All these steps are related to simulation intelligence, thought patterns, and cognition models. Ancient tablets were damaged by human hands and eroded by the environment, thus considerably degrading their original appearance. Automated reconstruction of the characters represented in the tablets, completed in the past by an experienced expert, is a necessary preprocessing stage that simulates the imagery thinking of calligraphy creation. Following reconstruction, a stroke-reforming approach based on statistical models generates new calligraphic styles. We present the results of this approach and discuss ongoing problems.

978	Toward Human Level Machine Intelligence - Is It Achievable? The Need for a Paradigm Shift	Zadeh, Lotfi A.	Computational Intelligence Magazine, IEEE	20080716	"Officially, AI was born in 1956. Since then, very impressive progress has been made in many areas - but not in the realm of human level machine intelligence. During much of its early history, AI ""was rife ""with exaggerated expectations. A headline in an article published in the late forties of last century was headlined, ""Electric brain capable of translating foreign languages is being built"". Today, more than half a century later, we do have translation software, but nothing that can approach the quality of human translation. Clearly, achievement of human level machine intelligence is a challenge that is hard to meet. A prerequisite to achievement of human level machine intelligence is mechanization of these capabilities and, in particular, mechanization of natural language understanding. To make significant progress toward achievement of human level machine intelligence, a paradigm shift is needed. More specifically, what is needed is an addition to the armamentarium of AI of two methodologies: (a) a nontraditional methodology of computing with words (CW) or more generally, NL-Computation; and (b) a countertraditional methodology ""which involves a progression from computing with numbers to computing with words. The centerpiece of these methodologies is the concept of precisiation of meaning. Addition of these methodologies to AI would be an important step toward the achievement of human level machine intelligence and its applications in decision-making, pattern recognition, analysis of evidence, diagnosis, and assessment of causality. Such applications have a position of centrality in our infocentric society."	,Artificial intelligence;Customer service;History;Humans;Machine intelligence;Natural languages;Performance evaluation;Physics computing;Software quality;Testing

Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Pentacene-based organic thin-film transistors have been fabricated using photolithography and the bottom contact structure using parylene as the gate dielectric. Device performance was optimized by varying the thickness ratio of pentacene to Au contacts. Contact resistance dependence on the pentacene/Au thickness ratio (r=tpen/tAu) was extracted using the transfer-length method [D. K. Schroder, Semiconductor Material and Device Characterization (Wiley, New York, 2006), pp. 184ﾖ199; Necliudov etal, Solid-State Electron. 47, 259 (2003)]. In this paper, we show that the effect of parasitic resistance and pentacene film morphology on device performance can be decoupled. Film morphology and microstructure are reported as a function of pentacene thickness and the correlation with transistor field-effect mobility is discussed.	contact resistance;field effect transistors;gold;organic semiconductors;photolithography;semiconductor device measurement;semiconductor thin films;semiconductor-metal boundaries;thin film transistors6855ag;6855jd;7340Cg;7340Ns;8530De;8530Tv,

983	Bots Get Smart	Schaeffer, J.; Bulitko, V.; Buro, M.	Spectrum, IEEE	20081202	The main challenge in making video games is to make computer-generated characters-dubbed bots-act realistically. They must, of course, look good and move naturally. But, ideally, they should also be able to engage in believable conversations, plan their actions, find their way around virtual worlds, and learn from their mistakes. That is, they need to be smart. Today many video games create only an illusion of intelligence, using a few programming tricks. But in the not-so -distant future, game bots will routinely use sophisticated AI techniques to shape their behavior. We and our colleagues in the University of Alberta GAMES (game-playing, analytical methods, minimax search and empirical studies) research group, in Edmonton, Canada, have been working to help bring about such a revolution.	,Artificial intelligence;Games;Minimax techniques;Shape,artificial intelligence;avatars;computer gamesAI techniques;Alberta University;GAMES research group;artificial intelligence;computer-generated characters;game bots;video games;virtual worlds

The absorption spectra indicate that the transition cross section of Er3+ ions decreases with increasing MgO concentration; it is explained as the improvement of the Er3+-site symmetries. A new Er3+ energy site with low energy, which appears in the long wavelength side of the polarized fluorescence spectra for the samples heavily codoped with MgO, is demonstrated in the time-resolved luminescence spectra. An important finding is that mild codoping with MgO clearly does not facilitate the formation of clustered sites, whereas heavy codoping clearly does facilitate it in Er3+-doped LiNbO3 crystals. These results are important to those who consider the material as a 1.5ﾠ?m laser or fiber optical cable.	doping;erbium;fluorescence;lithium compounds;magnesium compounds;time resolved spectra6172up;7847Cd;7855Hx,

Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy was used to obtain the time dependent transformation fraction and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was employed to analyze the vacancy-type defects in electroplated copper (Cu) during room-temperature microstructrual evolution. It was found that PALS is more sensitive than FIB to show the room-temperature microstructual evolution of electroplated Cu at the first stage of self-annealing. The majority of defects in electroplated Cu are dislocation-bound vacancies and vacancy clusters. Both the size and the concentration of the defects are similar for the two samples at the completion of electroplating. During the incubation time, the mean size of vacancy-type defects increases. After the onset of visible grain growth, the size of vacancy-type defects decreases. The detail evolutions of defects differ with the two samples.

We develop hypotheses based on the proposition that synchronous communication media are perceived to be more effective for convergence communication while asynchronous communication media are perceived to be more suitable for conveyance communication. These hypotheses were tested using data collected from 81 IM users in four organizations by means of survey instruments developed for this study. The results suggest that although IM was perceived to be a highly synchronous communication medium, it was not perceived to be as effective for convergence communication as it was for conveyance communication. These results seem to challenge the general propositions of media capacity theories. Theoretical implications are discussed.

992	An Intelligent Paging Strategy Using Rule-Based AI Technique for Locating Mobile Terminals in Cellular Wireless Networks	Maitra, M.; Saha, D.; Bhattacharjee, P.S.; Mukherjee, A.	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20080516	This paper proposes an efficient rule-based paging strategy (RBPS) using a well-known concept of artificial intelligence, namely, rule base. The novelty of the scheme lies in devising ldquorulesrdquo that offer a potential mapping from seemingly disparate input data items (yet having some statistical relations) to an almost exact position of mobile terminals (MTs). Considering the conventional models of call arrival, cell residence, and mobility, we have developed a stochastic model to analyze the performance of the scheme. Interestingly, RBPS requires no additional processing at MTs and involves a nominal overhead at mobile switching centers. Simulation results reveal that RBPS significantly outperforms the blanket paging scheme adopted in global system for mobile (GSM) communications. In addition, results are very much encouraging when compared with the popular shortest-distance-first scheme. Finally, RBPS is generic enough to be potentially used in next-generation wireless networks, irrespective of any standards, with only minor adaptations to conform to the respective standards.

993	Adaptation in Digital Games	Magerko, B.	Computer	20080624	Designers typically create digital games for either a specific audience, such as fans of the first-person shooter genre, or for mass appeal, such as Will Wright's The Sims (http://thesims.ea.com/us). These games encapsulate the designer's hypothesis for what a particular and ideally large population would enjoy playing. Digital games, unlike traditional media such as film or even board games, have the unique advantage of using computing power to break beyond this simple notion of designing for the masses. Games are, more than most media, mutable, flexible, and confined only by the data and reasoning we as developers give them.

994	Dielectric properties of epoxy nanocomposites	Singha, S.; Thomas, M.J.	Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, IEEE Transactions on	20080207	The dielectric properties of epoxy nanocomposites with insulating nano-fillers, viz., TiO2, ZnO and AI2O3 were investigated at low filler concentrations by weight. Epoxy nanocomposite samples with a good dispersion of nanoparticles in the epoxy matrix were prepared and experiments were performed to measure the dielectric permittivity and tan delta (400 Hz-1 MHz), dc volume resistivity and ac dielectric strength. At very low nanoparticle loadings, results demonstrate some interesting dielectric behaviors for nanocomposites and some of the electrical properties are found to be unique and advantageous for use in several existing and potential electrical systems. The nanocomposite dielectric properties are analyzed in detail with respect to different experimental parameters like frequency (for permittivity/tan delta), filler size, filler concentration and filler permittivity. In addition, epoxy microcomposites for the same systems were synthesized and their dielectric properties were compared to the results already obtained for nanocomposites. The interesting dielectric characteristics for epoxy based nanodielectric systems are attributed to the large volume fraction of interfaces in the bulk of the material and the ensuing interactions between the charged nanoparticle surface and the epoxy chains.	,Artificial intelligence;Dielectric measurements;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Dispersion;Nanocomposites;Nanoparticles;Performance evaluation;Permittivity measurement;Volume measurement;Zinc oxide,alumina;dielectric losses;electrical resistivity;insulating materials;nanocomposites;nanoparticles;permittivity;titanium compounds;zinc compoundsdc volume resistivity;dielectric permittivity;dielectric tan delta;epoxy nanocomposites;filler concentrations;insulating nano-fillers;nanoparticles							
995	Cheek to Chip: Dancing Robots and AI's Future	Aucouturier, J.-J.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20080321	Recent generations of humanoid robots increasingly resemble humans in shape and articulatory capacities. This progress has motivated researchers to design dancing robots that can mimic the complexity and style of human choreographic dancing. Such complicated actions are usually programmed manually and ad hoc. However, this approach is both tedious and inflexible. Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed the learning-from-observation (LFO) training method to overcome this difficulty.1-2 LFO enables a robot to acquire knowledge of what to do and how to do it from observing human demonstrations. Direct mapping from human joint angles to robot joint angles doesn't work well because of the dynamic and kinematic differences between the observed person and the robot (for example, weight, balance, and arm and leg lengths). LFO therefore relies on predesigned task models, which represent only the actions (and features thereof) that are essential to mimicry. Then it adapts these actions to the robot's morphology and dynamics so that it can mimic the movement. This indirect, two-step mapping is crucial for robust imitation and performance.

996	Remarkable Increase in the Channel Mobility of SiC-MOSFETs by Controlling the Interfacial    Layer Between    and SiC	Hatayama, T.; Hino, S.; Miura, N.; Oomori, Tatsuo; Tokumitsu, Eisuke	Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on	20080725	The impact of a thin SiO2 layer inserted between Al2O3 and SiC on channel mobility in AI2O3/SiC MOSFETs was investigated. The remarkable increase in the channel mobility is demonstrated when the SiO2 thickness is around 1 nm. The thin SiO2 layer is formed by the thermal oxidation of the SiC substrate at 600 or 800degC in O2 atmosphere. The peak value of the field-effect mobility in AI2O3/SiO2/SiC MOSFETs is as high as 300 cm2 / (V ldr s). On the other hand, when the SiO2 layer is 2.0 nm, the field-effect mobility drastically reduces to 40 cm2/ (V ldr s), which is most likely due to the high interface trap density as seen in conventional SiO2/SiC MOSFETs.

997	Cross-Layer Optimal Policies for Spatial Diversity Relaying in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks	Jing Ai; Abouzeid, A.A.; Zhenzhen Ye	Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20080819	"In order to adapt to time-varying wireless channels, various channel-adaptive schemes have been proposed to exploit inherent spatial diversity in mobile/wireless ad hoc networks where there are usually alternate next-hop relays available at a given forwarding node. However, current schemes along this line are designed based on heuristics, implying room for performance enhancement. To seek a theoretical foundation for improving spatial diversity gain, we formulate the selection of the next-hop as a sequential decision problem and propose a general ""optimal stopping relaying (OSR)"" framework for designing such next-hop diversity schemes. As a particular example, assuming Rayleigh fading channels, we implement an OSR strategy to optimize information efficiency (IE) in a protocol stack consisting of greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) and IEEE 802.11 MAC protocols. We present mathematical analysis of the proposed OSR together with other strategies in literature for a single forwarding node. In addition, we perform extensive simulations (using QualNet) to evaluate the end-to-end performance of these relaying strategies in a multi-hop network. Both the mathematical and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of OSR over other existing schemes."

998	Scanning near-field optical microscopy study of metallic square hole array nanostructures	Li, Jiang-Yan; Zhi-Yuan Li; Yang, Hai-Fang; Jin, Ai-Zi	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	We fabricate periodic arrays of simple-square and composite-square air hole nanostructures on a 120 nm thick Au film deposited on glass substrate by focused ion beam technology and study their optical properties by examining the optical near-field distribution via scanning near-field optical microscopy in the near-infrared region. The simple-square nanostructure only contains one square air hole in each unit cell, while the composite-square one contains the same size square air hole in the center and eight smaller square air holes in the periphery. The measured optical near-field patterns for the two nanostructures show very different distribution features. High intensity light spots locate within the central square air hole in the simple-square structure, while they sit at the peripheral smaller square air holes in the composite-square structure. Numerical simulations based on the plane-wave transfer-matrix method have been carried out to analyze the optical near-field patterns for the two metallic nanostructures and agree well with the experimental data. The results indicate that light interaction with metallic nanostructures is very sensitive to even a small change in the subtle geometrical feature. Meanwhile, by comparing near-field patterns with dielectric nanostructures theoretically, we also find that optical confinement is better for gold nanostructures than for dielectric nanostructures.	nanostructured materials;optical microscopy4270Qs;4753+n;7866Bz,							
999	Principle and Application of a Sensitive Handy Electrooptic Probe for Sub-100-MHz Frequency Range Signal Measurements	Sasaki, A.; Shinagawa, M.	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20080331	We have developed a new handy electrooptic (EO) probe to measure signals whose frequency is lower than 100 MHz. A distinct feature of the new EO probe is a long metal rod attached to an EO modulator. Measurement sensitivity does not depend on geometrical structures of devices under test (DUTs) with our new EO probe, whereas it does depend on geometrical structures of DUTs with a conventional handy EO probe. The sensitivity is at least 18 dB higher than that of the conventional one. In this paper, we qualitatively explain the effects of the rod on sensitivity and show experimental results, which agree well with the explanation. The advantages of signal measurements with an EO probe are also discussed, and two applications, where an EO probe plays important and essential roles, are proposed.

Absorption spectrum and modified Judd-Ofelt approach were used to investigate its spectroscopic properties. The bright blue and intense yellow emissions are assigned to transitions 4F9/2?6H15/2 and 4F9/2?6H13/2, respectively. It is concluded that the main upconversion mechanism is excited state absorption by pump power dependence in combination with luminescence intensity temporal evolvements.

This framework has two levels: one is local to a single ATM, while the other is network-wide. The framework employs vaccination and adaptability analogies of the immune system. For discriminating between normal and erroneous states, an immune-inspired one-class supervised algorithm was employed, which supports continual learning and adaptation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was confirmed in terms of classification performance and impact on availability. The overall results are encouraging as the downtime of ATMs can de reduced by anticipating the occurrence of failures before they actually occur.

Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on	20070305	Spiking neural network (NN) architecture that uses Hebbian learning and reinforcement-learning schemes for adapting the synaptic weights is implemented in silicon and performs dynamic optimization according to hemodynamic sensor for a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. The spiking NN architecture dynamically changes the atrioventricular (AV) delay and interventricular (VV) interval parameters according to the information provided by the intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) and hemodynamic sensors. The spiking NN coprocessor performs the adaptive part and is controlled by a deterministic algorithm master controller. The simulated cardiac output obtained with the adaptive CRT device is 30% higher than with a nonadaptive CRT device and is likely to provide improvement in the quality of life for patients with congestive heart failure. The spiking NN architecture shows synaptic plasticity acquired during the learning process.

1005	Anti-interference ultra-wideband system based on spreading and interleaving	Shibing, Zhang; Lijun, Zhang	Systems Engineering and Electronics, Journal of	20120117	To suppress the interference in the ultra-wideband (AI-UWB) system is a challenging problem. An anti-interference multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ultra-wideband (AI-UWB) system, based on spreading and interleaving is addressed. It will exploit the frequency diversity across the subcarriers and provide the robustness to narrow-band interference, by spreading the coded bit streams within each sub-band and interleaving across all sub-bands. Simulating results show that the spreading and interleaving provide about 5 dB to 10 dB advantages over the conventional multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ultra-wideband system in signal-to-interference ratio. Spreading and interleaving is an effective cure for enhancing the robustness to narrowband interference.

1006	Time-Efficient Quasi-Static Algorithm for Simulation of Complex Single-Sided Clamped Electrostatic Actuators	Oberhammer, J.; Liu, A.Q.; Stemme, G.	Microelectromechanical Systems, Journal of	20070410	"This paper reports on a very time- and resource-efficient numerical algorithm for quasi-static modeling of the static behavior and the ""quasi-static movement"" of highly nonlinear electrostatic actuators with single-side clamped moving elements. The algorithm is capable of simulating prestressed materials and multicontact touching surfaces with complex geometries, including distance-keeping stoppers and thickness and material inhomogeneities of the moving parts. Thus, it is very suitable for predicting the behavior of actuators such as laterally moving curved-electrode actuators or vertically moving touch-mode or zipper actuators. In contrast to conventional, very time- and memory-consuming simulation methods such as finite-element analysis, the proposed algorithm-even if implemented in the slow script-language of MATLAB-takes only a fraction of a second to solve a complex problem, which makes it a very powerful design tool for parameter optimization of the actuator geometry. The reason for the efficiency of this algorithm is that its core is based on the one-dimensional mathematical description of a two-dimensional model geometry and that the differential equation is solved by a simple triple-integration for each iteration step, which is a method very suitable for thin-film single-side clamped moving elements. This paper describes the algorithm, analyzes its accuracy and its limitations, and reports on its performance as compared to other methods such as simplified analytical models for very basic structures, finite-element method (FEM) simulations of complex structures, and measurements of fabricated devices, including laterally moving microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches and vertically closing prestressed thin-film zipper actuators. Furthermore, the efficiency of the algorithm as a design tool was evaluated for the parameter optimization of electrostatic curved-electrode actuators. The algorithm's main application is seen in the fast determination of su- - itable parameter sets for MEMS electrostatic actuators, but it cannot substitute for a more accurate FEM analysis to investigate a final design in great detail"	Curved-electrode actuator;MEMS simulation;design optimization;electrostatic actuator;microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) design;quasi-static modeling;touch-mode actuator,Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computer languages;Design optimization;Electrostatic actuators;Finite element methods;Geometry;Mathematical model;Micromechanical devices;Solid modeling,electrostatic actuators;microswitches;thin film devicesMEMS simulation;clamped electrostatic actuators;curved electrode actuators;design optimization;microelectromechanical systems switches;parameter optimization;thin film zipper actuators;time efficient quasi static algorithm;touch mode actuator							
1007	Identification of an Electric Resistance Furnace	Kam Chee Chook; Ai Hui Tan	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20071206	In this paper, the identification of an electric resistance furnace is described. Physical modeling is applied to obtain a mathematical description that captures the static and dynamic behavior of the furnace. Experimental data are collected and used for estimating the parameters of the furnace, which is found to be a dominantly first-order system. First-order linear, bilinear, and direction-dependent models are employed to describe the characteristics of the furnace. A comparison between the quality of these models is made.

1008	A Low-Power Asynchronous Interleaved Sampling Algorithm for Cochlear Implants That Encodes Envelope and Phase Information	Ji-Jon Sit; Simonson, A.M.; Oxenham, A.J.; Faltys, M.A.; Sarpeshkar, R.	Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20061219	Cochlear implants currently fail to convey phase information, which is important for perceiving music, tonal languages, and for hearing in noisy environments. We propose a bio-inspired asynchronous interleaved sampling (AIS) algorithm that encodes both envelope and phase information, in a manner that may be suitable for delivery to cochlear implant users. Like standard continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) strategies, AIS naturally meets the interleaved-firing requirement, which is to stimulate only one electrode at a time, minimizing electrode interactions. The majority of interspike intervals are distributed over 1-4 ms, thus staying within the absolute refractory limit of neurons, and form a more natural, pseudostochastic pattern of firing due to complex channel interactions. Stronger channels are selected to fire more often but the strategy ensures that weaker channels are selected to fire in proportion to their signal strength as well. The resulting stimulation rates are considerably lower than those of most modern implants, saving power yet delivering higher potential performance. Correlations with original sounds were found to be significantly higher in AIS reconstructions than in signal reconstructions using only envelope information. Two perceptual tests on normal-hearing listeners verified that the reconstructed signals enabled better melody and speech recognition in noise than those processed using tone-excited envelope-vocoder simulations of cochlear implant processing. Thus, our strategy could potentially save power and improve hearing performance in cochlear implant users	Asynchronous stimulation;cochlear implant;neural stimulation;phase information,Acoustic noise;Auditory system;Cochlear implants;Computational Intelligence Society;Electrodes;Fires;Neurons;Phase noise;Sampling methods;Working environment noise,bioelectric phenomena;biomedical electrodes;ear;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;prosthetics;sampling methods;signal reconstruction;speech coding;speech recognition1 to 4 ms;cochlear implants;continuous interleaved sampling;envelope encoding;interleaved-firing requirement;interspike intervals;low-power asynchronous interleaved sampling algorithm;melody recognition;neurons;phase information encoding;pseudostochastic firing pattern;signal reconstruction;speech recognition;tone-excited envelope-vocoder simulationsAlgorithms;Cochlear Implants;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Information Storage and Retrieval;Sound Spectrography;Speech Recognition Software;Therapy, Computer-Assisted							
1009	A Scalable Machine Learning Approach to Go		Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 19:Proceedings of the 2006 Conference	20120924	Go is an ancient board game that poses unique opportunities and challenges for AI and machine learning. Here we develop a machine learning approach to Go, and related board games, focusing primarily on the problem of learning a good evaluation function in a scalable way. Scalability is essential at multiple levels, from the library of local tactical patterns, to the integration of patterns across the board, to the size of the board itself. The system we propose is capable of automatically learning the propensity of local patterns from a library of games. Propensity and other local tactical information are fed into a recursive neural network, derived from a Bayesian network architecture. The network integrates local information across the board and produces local outputs that represent local territory ownership probabilities. The aggregation of these probabilities provides an effective strategic evaluation function that is an estimate of the expected area at the end (or at other stages) of the game. Local area targets for training can be derived from datasets of human games. A system trained using only 9 � 9 amateur game data performs surprisingly well on a test set derived from 19 � 19 professional game data. Possible directions for further improvements are briefly discussed.

1012	Use of Satellite Data to Study the Impact of Forest Fires Over the Northeast Region of India	Badarinath, K.V.S.; Kharol, S.K.; Chand, T.R.K.	Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, IEEE	20070716	Tropical biomass burning and associated emissions of aerosols into the atmosphere play a vital role in atmospheric perturbation and climate change. This letter aims at investigating the impact of forest fires on aerosol concentration over the northeast region of India, with the use of satellite data. The forests of northeast India are subjected to severe fire episodes during the January-May period every year mainly due to slash-and-burn agricultural practices. Daily active forest fire locations over the northeastern region were derived using nighttime satellite data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Line Scan system. These data were compared with variations in the aerosol index derived from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer along with the aerosol optical depth derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The analysis covered the period January-May 2006. The satellite data analysis suggested a maximum number of forest fires between February and April. The results clearly suggested a significant correlation between forest fire occurrences and variations in the aerosol concentrations over the study region.

1013	Generating Compact Classifier Systems Using a Simple Artificial Immune System	Leung, K.; Cheong, F.; Cheong, C.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20070924	Current artificial immune system (AIS) classifiers have two major problems: 1) their populations of B-cells can grow to huge proportions, and 2) optimizing one B-cell (part of the classifier) at a time does not necessarily guarantee that the B-cell pool (the whole classifier) will be optimized. In this paper, the design of a new AIS algorithm and classifier system called simple AIS is described. It is different from traditional AIS classifiers in that it takes only one B-cell, instead of a B-cell pool, to represent the classifier. This approach ensures global optimization of the whole system, and in addition, no population control mechanism is needed. The classifier was tested on seven benchmark data sets using different classification techniques and was found to be very competitive when compared to other classifiers.

1014	Comparison of the non linear energy operator and the Hilbert transform in the estimation of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency	Diaz, M.; Esteller, R.

In this article the features ai and fi of simulated and experimental (real EEG and ECG) signals, are estimated using three methods: one based on the Hilbert Transform (HT), a modified version of this that improves the fi estimation in experimental signals (HTM), and the energy separation algorithm (DESA1), based on Teagerﾒs energy operator (TEO). The algorithm comparison is made using the average relative error obtained in the signalsﾒ demodulation process, their noise sensitivity, and computational efficiency. The obtained results showed that the HTM method produces the least fi estimation errors in noisy signals, and depending on the kind of signal considered, DESA1 and HTM methods produce the least ai estimation errors.

An enhanced sensor node has been designed and fabricated to add controlled mobility to wireless sensor networks. The mobile node is capable of simple planar motions and is easy to be controlled through different user interfaces. A testbed including the static nodes as well as the mobile node has also been created for validating the basic functions of the proposed hybrid sensor network system.

1017	A Real Pivot Structure for MEMS Tunable Lasers	Zhang, X.M.; Liu, A.Q.; Lu, C.; Tang, D.Y.	Microelectromechanical Systems, Journal of	20070410	This paper presents the design of a real pivot formed by a double-clamped beam for the rotational tuning structures in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) tunable lasers. Micromechanical properties such as beam deformation, pivot position and pivot shift are investigated and compared with the virtual pivot formed by a cantilever beam. It is shown that the real pivot has negligible shift when subjected to load and fabrication error owing to its feature of structural symmetry, while the virtual pivot suffers from significant pivot shift, which would severely limit the wavelength tuning range. The two pivot designs are implemented into MEMS tuning structures that are fabricated by deep etching and released using a dry release approach. The real pivot measures a depth variation of 16% over the double-clamped beam but maintains the symmetry to the midpoint, and is still able to produce a rotation angle of 4.7deg. In contrast, the virtual pivot has a depth reduction of 4% over the cantilever beam, but achieves only a 2.4deg rotation due to the pull-in problem originated from the severe pivot shift. The real pivot design is more suitable for the MEMS tunable lasers as it is simple, symmetric, robust, and suitable for single-chip integration	External-cavity tunable lasers;microelectromechanical systems (MEMS);micromechanics;pivot;rotary comb drive,Dry etching;Laser beams;Laser tuning;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Optical design;Optical device fabrication;Rotation measurement;Structural beams;Tunable circuits and devices,beams (structures);cantilevers;deformation;laser tuning;micromechanical devicesMEMS tunable lasers;MEMS tuning structures;beam deformation;cantilever beam;deep etching;double-clamped beam;dry release approach;external-cavity tunable lasers;microelectromechanical systems;micromechanical properties;micromechanics;pivot position;pivot shift;real pivot structure;rotary comb drive;rotational tuning structures;structural symmetry							
1018	String Tightening as a Self-Organizing Phenomenon	Banerjee, B.	Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on	20070904	The phenomenon of self-organization has been of special interest to the neural network community throughout the last couple of decades. In this paper, we study a variant of the self-organizing map (SOM) that models the phenomenon of self-organization of the particles forming a string when the string is tightened from one or both of its ends. The proposed variant, called the string tightening self-organizing neural network (STON), can be used to solve certain practical problems, such as computation of shortest homotopic paths, smoothing paths to avoid sharp turns, computation of convex hull, etc. These problems are of considerable interest in computational geometry, robotics path-planning, artificial intelligence (AI) (diagrammatic reasoning), very large scale integration (VLSI) routing, and geographical information systems. Given a set of obstacles and a string with two fixed terminal points in a 2-D space, the STON model continuously tightens the given string until the unique shortest configuration in terms of the Euclidean metric is reached. The STON minimizes the total length of a string on convergence by dynamically creating and selecting feature vectors in a competitive manner. Proof of correctness of this anytime algorithm and experimental results obtained by its deployment have been presented in the paper.

1019	High-Speed Digitizing of Repetitive Waveforms Using Accurate Interleaved Sampling	Ivchenko, V.G.; Kalashnikov, A.N.; Challis, R.E.; Hayes-Gill, B.R.	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20070723	"Random interleaved sampling has become a widespread operating mode for digital storage oscilloscopes. Different repetitions of (notionally) the same waveform are recorded at random time shifts and are interleaved in memory, resulting in an increase of the equivalent sampling frequency. This procedure requires substantial time, particularly if further averaging is required. In this paper, an approach that ensures accurate time shifts is presented for repeated waveform measurements. Operating two independent oscillators with related frequencies forms the accurate shifts. One of these is used to excite a waveform of interest repeatedly, and the other clocks the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This architecture was implemented using a commercial ""off-the-shelf"" field programmable gate array. Examples of experimental waveforms, which are sampled at 2160 MHz using an ADC that is clocked at 80 MHz, are presented. They are compared with the simulated and independently measured waveforms where appropriate."

1020	Ternary input signal design for system identification	Barker, H.A.; Tan, A.H.; Godfrey, K.R.	Control Theory & Applications, IET	20070827	Methods for designing two types of periodic ternary input signal used to identify a system in the presence of both noise and nonlinear distortions have been described here. Signals of the first type have even harmonics suppressed, to eliminate errors in odd-order estimates from even-order distortions, and vice-versa. Signals of the second type have harmonic multiples of both two and three suppressed, to further reduce errors from nonlinear distortions. For both types of signal, three design criteria are defined. The first criterion allows the signal energy-amplitude ratio to be maximised, the second allows the signal spectrum uniformity to be maximised and the third allows a compromise to be made between the first two criteria. With the methods described, ternary signals of both types with a very wide range of periods can be obtained for use in this application. Software for computer-aided design of the signals is available on the Internet. The signals and their periods are given in tables, and an example is used to show how they are applied.	harmonic distortion;harmonics suppression;identification;noise;spectral analysisnoise distortions;nonlinear distortions;signal energy-amplitude ratio;signal spectrum uniformity;system identification;ternary input signal design

For game developers, Al has come to mean the broad range of techniques used to generate the behavior of these opponents, battlefield units, team mates, NPCs, or anything else that acts in the game with simulated intelligence. A few of these techniques, such as finite state machines and the heuristic A* search algorithm, have proven themselves in many games over the years. Following the A* search algorithm's path, game developers are starting to explore techniques from several AI research subfields, including automated planning and machine learning.

The cellﾒs RI is a significant cell biophysical property which has potential in cancer and disease diagnoses. The single cell is trapped optically within the cavity, and the transmission spectra shift due to the change of surrounding buffer, without/with cell, are used to determine the cellﾒs effective RI and effective thickness. The measurement shows that Madin-Darby canine kidney cell has an effective RI of 1.383ﾱ0.001. Moreover, the optical trapping technique eliminates uncertainty and avoids cell damage.

1025	Temporal Symmetry in Primary Auditory Cortex: Implications for Cortical Connectivity	Simon, J; Depireux, D; Klein, D; Fritz, J; Shamma, S	Neural Computation	20140519	Neurons in primary auditory cortex (AI) in the ferret (Mustela putorius) that are well described by their spectrotemporal response field (STRF) are found also to have a distinctive property that we call temporal symmetry. For temporally symmetric neurons, every temporal cross-section of the STRF (impulse response) is given by the same function of time, except for a scaling and a Hilbert rotation. This property held in 85% of neurons (123 out of 145) recorded from awake animals and in 96% of neurons (70 out of 73) recorded from anesthetized animals. This property of temporal symmetry is highly constraining for possible models of functional neural connectivity within and into AI. We find that the simplest models of functional thalamic input, from the ventral medial geniculate body (MGB), into the entry layers of AI are ruled out because they are incompatible with the constraints of the observed temporal symmetry. This is also the case for the simplest models of functional intracortical connectivity. Plausible models that do generate temporal symmetry, from both thalamic and intracortical inputs, are presented. In particular, we propose that two specific characteristics of the thalamocortical interface may be responsible. The first is a temporal mismatch between the fast dynamics of the thalamus and the slow responses of the cortex. The second is that all thalamic inputs into a cortical module (or a cluster of cells) must be restricted to one point of entry (or one cell in the cluster). This latter property implies a lack of correlated horizontal interactions across cortical modules during the STRF measurements. The implications of these insights in the auditory system, and comparisons with similar properties in the visual system, are explored.								
1026	A Distribution-Index-Based Discretizer for Decision-Making with Symbolic AI Approaches	QingXiang Wu; Bell, D.A.; Prasad, G.; McGinnity, T.M.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20061130	When symbolic AI approaches are applied to handle continuous valued attributes, there is a requirement to transform the continuous attribute values to symbolic data. In this paper, a novel distribution-index-based discretizer is proposed for such a transformation. Based on definitions of dichotomic entropy and a compound distributional index, a simple criterion is applied to discretize continuous attributes adaptively. The dichotomic entropy indicates the homogeneity degree of the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine the best splitting point. The compound distributional index combines both the homogeneity degrees of attribute value distributions and the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine which interval should be split further; thus, a potentially improved solution of the discretization problem can be found efficiently. Based on multiple reducts in rough set theory, a multiknowledge approach can attain high decision accuracy for information systems with a large number of attributes and missing values. In this paper, our discretizer is combined with the multiknowledge approach to further improve decision accuracy for information systems with continuous attributes. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the new discretizer can improve not only the multiknowledge approach, but also the naive Bayes classifier and the C5.0 tree	Data mining;decision support.;information theory;machine learning,Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Distributed decision making;Entropy;Information systems;Machine learning;Set theory;Testing,data mining;database indexing;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence)C5.0 tree;attribute value distribution;benchmark data set;compound distributional index;decision value distribution;decision-making;dichotomic entropy;distribution-index-based discretizer;homogeneity degree;multiknowledge approach;naive Bayes classifier;rough set theory;symbolic AI approach

The flashover studies are conducted separately using DC and 20 kHz AC signals. The voltage, current, and light emission waveforms are obtained. The optical data is collected by a video camera and a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The nano/micro composite dielectric samples used in the experiments are produced in-house by mixing 1:10 weight ratio of AI2O3 powder with epoxy resin of known properties.

1029	Toward Reducing Human Involvement in Validation of Knowledge-Based Systems	Knauf, R.; Tsuruta, S.; Gonzalez, A.J.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part A: Systems and Humans, IEEE Transactions on	20061219	Human experts employed in validation exercises for knowledge-based systems (KBSs) often have limited time and availability. Furthermore, they often have different opinions from each other as well as from themselves over time. We address this situation by introducing the use of validation knowledge used in prior validation exercises for the same KBS. We present a validation knowledge base (VKB) that is the collective best experience of several human experts. The VKB is constructed and maintained across various validation exercises, and its primary benefits are given as follows: 1) more reliable validation results by incorporating external knowledge and 2) decrease of the experts' workload. We also present the concept of validation expert software agents (VESAs), which represent a particular expert's knowledge. VESA is a software agent corresponding to a specific human expert. It models the validation knowledge and behavior of its human counterpart by analyzing similarities with the responses of other experts. After a learning period, it can be used to temporarily substitute for its corresponding human expert. We also describe experiments with a small prototype system to evaluate the usefulness of these concepts	Knowledge-based systems (KBSs);systems;validation knowledge;validation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems,Artificial intelligence;Humans;Information technology;Knowledge based systems;Learning;Maintenance;Prototypes;Safety;Software agents;System testing,knowledge based systems;program verificationknowledge-based systems validation;validation expert software agents;validation knowledge

Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Based on an effective propagation constant and a frequency-dependent dielectric constant, the plane wave method is extended to calculate the complex photonic band diagram and the density of states for electromagnetic waves propagating in a two-dimensional finite structure with nonoverlapping dielectric cylinders of arbitrary radii, which may be randomly embedded in a dielectric matrix. The effective propagation constant is obtained by using the Twersky formula [J. Math. Phys. 3, 700 (1962)] and the scattering matrix method. A case study shows that an embedded defect with optimal radius in a finite photonic crystal can increase the first photonic band gap as compared to the similar structure without the defect. This work is expected to provide a useful tool in determining the photonic properties of a disorder dielectric medium with arbitrary embedded nanoparticles and nanowires.	permittivity;photonic band gap;photonic crystals4270Qs;7722Ch,

1038	Idiotypic Immune Networks in Mobile-Robot Control	Whitbrook, A.M.; Aickelin, U.; Garibaldi, J.M.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20071119	Jerne's idiotypic-network theory postulates that the immune response involves interantibody stimulation and suppression, as well as matching to antigens. The theory has proved the most popular artificial immune system (AIS) model for incorporation into behavior-based robotics, but guidelines for implementing idiotypic selection are scarce. Furthermore, the direct effects of employing the technique have not been demonstrated in the form of a comparison with nonidiotypic systems. This paper aims to address these issues. A method for integrating an idiotypic AIS network with a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based control system is described, and the mechanisms underlying antibody stimulation and suppression are explained in detail. Some hypotheses that account for the network advantage are put forward and tested using three systems with increasing idiotypic complexity. The basic RL, a simplified hybrid AIS-RL that implements idiotypic selection independently of derived concentration levels, and a full hybrid AIS-RL scheme are examined.

1039	Surface Morphology and Microstructure of Thick YBa2Cu3O7?? Films on Vicinal r-Cut Sapphire Buffered With CeO2	Jia Cai Nie; Yamasaki, Hirofumi; Develos-Bagarinao, Katherine; Nakagawa, Y.	Applied Superconductivity, IEEE Transactions on	20070723	Microcrack-free thick YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) films were successfully fabricated by pulsed laser deposition on deliberately miscut AI2O3 (1102) (5.22deg off towards [1102]) buffered with CeO2. Characterization of the films revealed a porous morphology, consisting of interconnected islands and deep holes (pores). The microstructure of the YBCO films was further investigated by cross-section (cut along both AI2O3 [1101] and [1120] transmission electron microscopy (TEM). No apparent interface reaction is seen for all the TEM observations. A high density of linear defects aligned near c-axis are frequently observed. All the defects are initiated from the YBCO / CeO2 interface, indicating the importance of the microstructure of the CeO2 buffer layer and the sapphire substrate for the growth of YBCO. In addition, numerous small stacking faults lying in the alpha - b-plane of YBCO were produced by the linear defects. The high density of the growth-induced defects may act as strong pinning centers in YBCO films and therefore increase Jc of the film.

1040	Total Energy Shaping Control of Mechanical Systems: Simplifying the Matching Equations Via Coordinate Changes	Viola, G.; Ortega, R.; Banavar, R.; Acosta, J.A.; Astolfi, A.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20070618	Total energy shaping is a controller design methodology that achieves (asymptotic) stabilization of mechanical systems endowing the closed-loop system with a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian structure with a desired energy function - that qualifies as Lyapunov function for the desired equilibrium. The success of the method relies on the possibility of solving two PDEs which identify the kinetic and potential energy functions that can be assigned to the closed loop. Particularly troublesome is the partial differential equation (PDE) associated to the kinetic energy which is nonlinear and inhomogeneous and the solution, that defines the desired inertia matrix, must be positive-definite. In this note, we prove that we can eliminate or simplify the forcing term in this PDE by modifying the target dynamics and introducing a change of coordinates in the original system. Furthermore, it is shown that, in the particular case of transformation to the Lagrangian coordinates, the possibility of simplifying the PDEs is determined by the interaction between the Coriolis and centrifugal forces and the actuation structure. The examples of pendulum on a cart and Furuta's pendulum are used to illustrate the results.

1042	Robust adaptive motion control of permanent magnet linear motors based on disturbance compensation	Zhang, D.L.; Chen, Y.P.; Zhou, Z.D.; Ai, W.; Li, X.D.	Electric Power Applications, IET	20070702	Unlike rotational motors, permanent magnetic linear motors (PMLMs) are more sensitive to various force disturbances because of the reduction of gears. The parameters of PMLMs are difficult to accurately measure and vary in experiments and applications. To efficiently control a PMLM and alleviate the influence of parameter variation, robust adaptive control method is proposed to be used in the motion control of PMLMs. The force ripple is the main force disturbance when the velocity is close to zero, but it is complex and difficult to be described by an accurate model. So, in the designed robust adaptive controller, an off-line backpropagation neural network is proposed to approximate the function of the force ripple. Simulation and experimental results show that the designed robust adaptive controller can obtain higher control precision and be robust to the parameter variation.	adaptive control;backpropagation;linear motors;motion control;neural nets;permanent magnet motors;robust controldisturbance compensation;off-line backpropagation neural network;permanent magnet linear motors;robust adaptive motion control

Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on	20071022	Theory and applications of model-based fault diagnosis have progressed significantly in the last four decades. In addition, there has been increased use of model-based design and testing in the automotive industry to reduce design errors, perform rapid prototyping, and hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS). This paper presents a new model-based diagnostic development process for automotive engine control systems. This process seamlessly employs a graph-based dependency model and mathematical models for online/offline diagnosis. The hybrid method improves the diagnostic system's accuracy and consistency, utilizes existing validated knowledge on empirical models, enables remote diagnosis, and responds to the challenges of increased system complexity.

1045	High-Performance Rotation Invariant Multiview Face Detection	Chang Huang; Haizhou Ai; Yuan Li; Shihong Lao	Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on	20070220	Rotation invariant multiview face detection (MVFD) aims to detect faces with arbitrary rotation-in-plane (RIP) and rotation-off-plane (ROP) angles in still images or video sequences. MVFD is crucial as the first step in automatic face processing for general applications since face images are seldom upright and frontal unless they are taken cooperatively. In this paper, we propose a series of innovative methods to construct a high-performance rotation invariant multiview face detector, including the width-first-search (WFS) tree detector structure, the vector boosting algorithm for learning vector-output strong classifiers, the domain-partition-based weak learning method, the sparse feature in granular space, and the heuristic search for sparse feature selection. As a result of that, our multiview face detector achieves low computational complexity, broad detection scope, and high detection accuracy on both standard testing sets and real-life images	AdaBoost;Pattern classification;face detection.;granular feature;rotation invariant;vector boosting,Boosting;Classification tree analysis;Computational complexity;Computer vision;Detectors;Face detection;Learning systems;Robustness;Testing;Video sequences,computational complexity;face recognition;image classification;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);tree searchingarbitrary rotation-in-plane;automatic face processing;computational complexity;domain-partition-based weak learning method;high-performance rotation invariant face detection;multiview face detection;rotation invariant multiview face detection;rotation-off-plane angle;sparse feature selection;still images;vector boosting algorithm;vector-output strong classifier learning;video sequences;width-first-search tree detector structureAlgorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity

A conventional micrometric ridge waveguide is first fabricated and then annealed to roughly detect the improvement of its optical properties. Then a nanometric 12-fold photonic quasicrystal waveguide is designed to further study its topography variation as well as the subtle influence on its optical properties with different post-FIB treatments. By comparing the experimental results with the theoretical results that are made by means of the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method, the authors find that the proposed low temperature liquid annealing method can efficiently improve the optical properties of photonic devices by decreasing Ga+ contamination, removing redeposited SiﾖSiO2 composites, and restoring damaged silicon lattice structures caused by Ga+ bombardment in the FIB micromachining.	annealing;composite materials;elemental semiconductors;finite difference time-domain analysis;focused ion beam technology;integrated optics;laser beam machining;micro-optics;micromachining;optical fabrication;optical waveguides;photonic crystals;quasicrystals;silicon;silicon compounds4282Cr;4282Et,

1049	Ready to leap to neo-creationism	Hayes-Roth, R.	Potentials, IEEE	20070917	Like the master puppet makers of the classic folk tales, artificial intelligence (AI) engineers have built some marvelous machines. The first 50 years of AI focused on programming computers to perform tasks that previously only humans could do tasks such as speech, driving, planning, problem solving and vacuuming. The principal challenges have been to create suitable language systems and inference engines and then to more or less manually stuff those with sufficient facts, heuristics and algorithms to perform well-defined tasks. To get there, we need a singularity of artificial neo-creationism, where we launch artificial beings into the world that can adapt, learn and evolve themselves. The term neo-creationism means an intentional effort to populate the world with intelligent entities initially engineered by humans. The biblical story of Genesis, the heart of creationism, provides an apt foil for understanding the goals and scope of the R&D program advocated here. To reach the goal reasonably quickly, we should equip these creatures with as much capability and knowledge as possible.	,Artificial intelligence;Engines;Heart;Heuristic algorithms;Humans;Inference algorithms;Knowledge acquisition;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Speech,artificial intelligence;research and developmentR&D program;artificial beings;artificial intelligence;computer programming;inference engines;intelligent entities;language systems;neo-creationism

Industry Applications, IEEE Transactions on	20071119	In this paper, a novel control method for a six-phase induction machine with nearly square air-gap flux density is proposed and evaluated. In this method, the stator phase windings alternately act as either flux- or torque-producing phases. In this way, the flux and the torque of the induction machine are directly controlled with no vector transformation used. Theoretical and finite-element analyses are used to calculate, among other things, the torque and the decouple control constant of the drive. The steady-state measured results of a small six-phase induction machine drive with the proposed control scheme implemented show good agreement with calculated results. The proposed control drive system is also shown to have a fast torque response.

1051	References		Autonomous Bidding Agents:Strategies and Lessons from the Trading Agent Competition	20120924	E-commerce increasingly provides opportunities for autonomous bidding agents: computer programs that bid in electronic markets without direct human intervention. Automated bidding strategies for an auction of a single good with a known valuation are fairly straightforward; designing strategies for simultaneous auctions with interdependent valuations is a more complex undertaking. This book presents algorithmic advances and strategy ideas within an integrated bidding agent architecture that have emerged from recent work in this fast-growing area of research in academia and industry. The authors analyze several novel bidding approaches that developed from the Trading Agent Competition (TAC), held annually since 2000. The benchmark challenge for competing agents--to buy and sell multiple goods with interdependent valuations in simultaneous auctions of different types--encourages competitors to apply innovative techniques to a common task. The book traces the evolution of TAC and follows selected agents from conception through several competitions, presenting and analyzing detailed algorithms developed for autonomous bidding. Autonomous Bidding Agents provides the first integrated treatment of methods in this rapidly developing domain of AI. The authors--who introduced TAC and created some of its most successful agents--offer both an overview of current research and new results. Michael P.

Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20070813	Deep-space missions carry an ever larger set of different and complementary onboard payloads. Each payload generates data, and synthesizing it for optimized downlinking is one way to reduce the ratio of mission costs to science return. This is the main role of the Mars-Express scheduling architecture (Mexar2), an Al-based tool in daily use on the Mars-Express mission since February 2005. Mexar2 supports space mission planners continuously as they plan data downlinks from the spacecraft to Earth. The tool lets planners work at a higher abstraction level while it performs low-level, often-repetitive tasks. It also helps them produce a plan rapidly, explore alternative solutions, and choose the most robust plan for execution. Additionally, planners can analyze any problems over multiple days and identify payload overcommitments that cause resource bottlenecks and increase the risk of data losses. Mexar2 has significantly increased the data return over the whole Mars-Express mission duration. It's effectively become a work companion for mission planners at the European Space Agency's European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany.

1055	A Reconfigurable Micromachined Switching Filter Using Periodic Structures	Karim, M.F.; Ai-Qun Liu; Alphones, A.; Aibin Yu	Microwave Theory and Techniques, IEEE Transactions on	20070611	In this paper, a reconfigurable filter using micromachined switches is designed, fabricated, and experimented. An equivalent-circuit model is derived for the reconfigurable cell structure. Extracted parameters show the characteristics of both bandpass and bandstop filters, which can be accurately analyzed using circuit analysis. Coplanar waveguide transmission lines for the reconfigurable filter are also analyzed. The bandpass filter is formed by cascading the unit cell structure. This bandpass filter can be switched to bandstop filter using the micromachined switches and p-i-n diode. Dispersion characteristics are obtained to investigate the electromagnetic wave behavior within the unit cell using Floquet's theorem. Measurement results with micromachined switches show that insertion loss is 1.55 dB for the bandpass filter whereas band rejection level is >20 dB and the insertion loss in the passband is 1.2 dB for the bandstop filter. With the p-i-n diode, the insertion loss is 2.1 dB and the 3-dB bandwidth is 5.2 GHz for the bandpass filter, the 20-dB rejection bandwidth is 5.3 GHz, and the insertion loss in the passband is 1.6 dB for the bandstop filter.

1057	Fault Diagnosis and Reconfiguration for Multilevel Inverter Drive Using AI-Based Techniques	Khomfoi, S.; Tolbert, L.M.	Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20071029	A fault diagnostic and reconfiguration method for a cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter drive (MLID) using artificial-intelligence-based techniques is proposed in this paper. Output phase voltages of the MLID are used as diagnostic signals to detect faults and their locations. It is difficult to diagnose an MLID system using a mathematical model because MLID systems consist of many switching devices and their system complexity has a nonlinear factor. Therefore, a neural network (NN) classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of an MLID system. Multilayer perceptron networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults. The principal component analysis is utilized in the feature extraction process to reduce the NN input size. A lower dimensional input space will also usually reduce the time necessary to train an NN, and the reduced noise can improve the mapping performance. The genetic algorithm is also applied to select the valuable principal components. The proposed network is evaluated with simulation test set and experimental test set. The overall classification performance of the proposed network is more than 95%. A reconfiguration technique is also proposed. The proposed fault diagnostic system requires about six cycles to clear an open-circuit or short-circuit fault. The experimental results show that the proposed system performs satisfactorily to detect the fault type, fault location, and reconfiguration.

The structure is fabricated by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology on a silicon-on-insulator wafer. It requires a temperature change of 69 K to switch from the transmission to the reflection states, which measure isolations of 15.6 and 40.1 dB, respectively.

The rotor position estimating techniques are used in a high-performance sensorless variable speed SRM drive. A digital signal processor, TMS320F2812, executes the rotor position estimation.

The temperature dependence of these characteristics was discussed in terms of the Rayleigh model. Although the Rayleigh law fits well the dielectric data below 140ﾠK, it cannot describe the data at higher temperatures, where a mechanism contributes to the dielectric constant without producing losses.

The exponential gain control function is realized using parasitic bipolar transistors and a control signal converter. The bandwidth is extended using an inductive peaking technique for high-frequency operations.

1067	In the News	Laurianne McLaughlin; Jan Krikke	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20070129	This paper discusses how some artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and search experts are using AI methods to try to improve the accuracy of video search results. One example is a University of Oxford project in which researchers use statistical machine learning, specifically computer vision methods for face detection and facial feature localization, to provide automatic annotation of video with information about all the content of the video. Another example is the video search engine from Blinkx that objectively analyzes video content using speech recognition and matches the spoken words to context gleaned from a massive database. Finally, researchers at Dartmouth University are working on a technology that shows whether images or video clips have been doctored. This technique uses support vector machines to differentiate computer-generated images from photographic images. The paper goes on to discuss computer Go programs. Go is an ancient Asian board game which has become a challenge for AI researchers around the world. Go is resistant to Deep Blue's brute-force search of the game tree; the number of possible moves is too large.

1069	Solution to the generalised sylvester matrix equation AV + BW = AVF	Wu, A.-G.; Duan, G.-R.	Control Theory & Applications, IET	20070312	An explicit solution to the generalised Sylvester matrix equation AV+BW=EVF, with the matrix F being in an arbitrary form, is proposed. The solution is in a neat form represented by a generalised symmetric operator matrix, the index-t R-controllability matrix associated with the matrix triple (E, A, B) and an index-t observability matrix. The presented approach allows the matrix F to be set undetermined. This solution can offer all the degrees of freedom. The result may give convenience and advantages to the computation and analysis of the solution to this type of matrix equations. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effect of the proposed approach.	controllability;matrix algebracontrollability matrix;explicit solution;generalised Sylvester matrix equation;generalised symmetric operator matrix;matrix triple							
1070	Sensor Integration for Satellite-Based Vehicular Navigation Using Neural Networks	Sharaf, R.; Noureldin, A.	Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on	20070305	Land vehicles rely mainly on global positioning system (GPS) to provide their position with consistent accuracy. However, GPS receivers may encounter frequent GPS outages within urban areas where satellite signals are blocked. In order to overcome this problem, GPS is usually combined with inertial sensors mounted inside the vehicle to obtain a reliable navigation solution, especially during GPS outages. This letter proposes a data fusion technique based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that integrates GPS with inertial sensors in real time.

1071	Dimensionality Reduction Based on Clonal Selection for Hyperspectral Imagery	Liangpei Zhang; Yanfei Zhong; Bo Huang; Jianya Gong; Pingxiang Li	Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20071119	A new stochastic search strategy inspired by the clonal selection theory in an artificial immune system is proposed for dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral remote-sensing imagery. The clonal selection theory is employed to describe the basic features of an immune response to an antigenic stimulus in order to meet the requirement of diversity in the antibody population. In our proposed strategy, dimensionality reduction is formulated as an optimization problem that searches an optimum with less number of features in a feature space. In line with this novel strategy, a feature subset search algorithm, clonal selection Feature-Selection (CSFS) algorithm, and a feature-weighting algorithm, Clonal-Selection Feature-Weighting (CSFW) algorithm, have been developed. In the CSFS, each solution is evolved in binary space, and the value of each bit is either 0 or 1, which indicates that the corresponding feature is either removed or selected, respectively. In CSFW, each antibody is directly represented by a string consisting of integer numbers and their corresponding weights. These algorithms are compared with the following four well-known algorithms: sequential forward selection, sequential forward floating selection, genetic-algorithm-based feature selection, and decision-boundary feature extraction using the hyperspectral remote-sensing imagery acquired by the Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager and the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that CSFS and CSFW outperform other algorithms and hence provide effective new options for dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral remote-sensing imagery.

1072	Transmitting light efficiently on photonic crystal surface waveguide bend	Khoo, E.H.; Cheng, T.H.; Liu, A.Q.; Li, J.; Pinjala, D.	Applied Physics Letters	20090618	In this letter, the transmission efficiency around waveguide bend on the surface of photonic crystal is investigated. Light is confined to the photonic crystal-air interface by means of surface modes. The transmission efficiency around surface waveguide bend is shown to be very poor. This is due to the phase mismatch of the wave vectors between different sections of the surface waveguide bend. To reduce the phase mismatch between the different waveguide sections, the cell properties at the bend section are modified. As a result, high transmission efficiency of more than 93% around the modified surface waveguide bend structure is achieved.	light transmission;photonic crystals;waveguide discontinuities4270Qs;8440Az,							
1073	Text-Independent Writer Identification and Verification Using Textural and Allographic Features	Bulacu, M.; Schomaker, L.	Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on	20070220	The identification of a person on the basis of scanned images of handwriting is a useful biometric modality with application in forensic and historic document analysis and constitutes an exemplary study area within the research field of behavioral biometrics. We developed new and very effective techniques for automatic writer identification and verification that use probability distribution functions (PDFs) extracted from the handwriting images to characterize writer individuality. A defining property of our methods is that they are designed to be independent of the textual content of the handwritten samples. Our methods operate at two levels of analysis: the texture level and the character-shape (allograph) level. At the texture level, we use contour-based joint directional PDFs that encode orientation and curvature information to give an intimate characterization of individual handwriting style. In our analysis at the allograph level, the writer is considered to be characterized by a stochastic pattern generator of ink-trace fragments, or graphemes. The PDF of these simple shapes in a given handwriting sample is characteristic for the writer and is computed using a common shape codebook obtained by grapheme clustering. Combining multiple features (directional, grapheme, and run-length PDFs) yields increased writer identification and verification performance. The proposed methods are applicable to free-style handwriting (both cursive and isolated) and have practical feasibility, under the assumption that a few text lines of handwritten material are available in order to obtain reliable probability estimates	Handwriting analysis;behavioral biometrics;grapheme-emission probability distribution.;joint directional probability distributions;writer identification and verification,Biometrics;Character generation;Forensics;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Pattern analysis;Probability distribution;Shape;Stochastic processes;Text analysis,handwriting recognition;pattern clustering;statistical distributions;text analysisallographic features;automatic writer identification;behavioral biometrics;biometric modality;character-shape analysis;common shape codebook;contour-based joint directional PDF;curvature information;forensic document analysis;free-style handwriting;grapheme clustering;handwriting images;historic document analysis;ink-trace fragments;person identification;probability distribution functions;stochastic pattern generator;text-independent writer identification;textural features;texture level analysisAlgorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Biometry;Handwriting;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface

The insertion loss measures 0.6 dB thanks to the three-dimentional optical coupling design. The linearity comes from the simultaneous shift and defocus of the laser beam. Compared with the conventional coaxial and cross-axial VOAs, such retro-axial design has the two fibers arranged on the same side and thus facilitates the use of standard packaging formats	Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS);parabolic micromirror;variable optical attenuator (VOA),Fiber lasers;Insertion loss;Linearity;Loss measurement;Microelectromechanical systems;Mirrors;Optical attenuators;Optical coupling;Optical design;Optical losses,laser beams;micro-optomechanical devices;micromirrors;optical attenuators;optical design techniques;optical losses;packagingcoaxial optical attenuator;cross-axial optical attenuator;insertion loss;laser beam defocus;microelectromechanical systems;mirror rotation angle;optical coupling design;parabolic mirror pair;retroaxial optical attenuator;retroreflector;standard packaging formats;three-dimensional optical coupling;variable optical attenuator

1077	A Supervised Artificial Immune Classifier for Remote-Sensing Imagery	Yanfei Zhong; Liangpei Zhang; Jianya Gong; Pingxiang Li	Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20071119	The artificial immune network (AIN), which is a new computational intelligence model based on artificial immune systems inspired by the vertebrate immune system, has been widely utilized for pattern recognition and data analysis. However, due to the inherent complexity of current AIN models, their application to remote-sensing image classification has been rather limited. This paper presents a novel supervised classification algorithm based on a multiple-valued immune network, which is a novel AIN model, to perform remote-sensing image classification. The proposed method trains the immune network using the samples of regions of interest and obtains an immune network with memory to classify the remote-sensing imagery. Two experiments with different types of images are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other traditional image classification algorithms: Parallelepiped, Minimum Distance, Maximum Likelihood, and Back-Propagation Neural Network. The results evince that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms the traditional algorithms in all the experiments and, hence, provides an effective option for processing remote-sensing imagery.

1078	Applications of Machine Learning to Cognitive Radio Networks	Clancy, C.; Hecker, J.; Stuntebeck, E.; O'Shea, T.	Wireless Communications, IEEE	20070910	Cognitive radio offers the promise of intelligent radios that can learn from and adapt to their environment. To date, most cognitive radio research has focused on policy-based radios that are hard-coded with a list of rules on how the radio should behave in certain scenarios. Some work has been done on radios with learning engines tailored for very specific applications. This article describes a concrete model for a generic cognitive radio to utilize a learning engine. The goal is to incorporate the results of the learning engine into a predicate calculus-based reasoning engine so that radios can remember lessons learned in the past and act quickly in the future. We also investigate the differences between reasoning and learning, and the fundamentals of when a particular application requires learning, and when simple reasoning is sufficient. The basic architecture is consistent with cognitive engines seen in AI research. The focus of this article is not to propose new machine learning algorithms, but rather to formalize their application to cognitive radio and develop a framework from within which they can be useful. We describe how our generic cognitive engine can tackle problems such as capacity maximization and dynamic spectrum access.	,Artificial intelligence;Cognitive radio;Concrete;Engines;Expert systems;Extrapolation;Logic;Machine learning;Software radio;Strontium,cognitive radio;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);radio networks;software radio;telecommunication computingcalculus-based reasoning engine prediction;capacity maximization;concrete model;dynamic spectrum access;generic cognitive radio network;machine learning engine;policy-based radio							
1079	Multiobjective Evolution of Neural Controllers and Task Complexity	Capi, G.	Robotics, IEEE Transactions on	20071218	Robots operating in everyday life environments are often required to switch between different tasks. While learning and evolution have been effectively applied to single task performance, multiple task performance still lacks methods that have been demonstrated to be both reliable and efficient. This paper introduces a new method for multiple task performance based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, where each task is considered as a separate objective function. In order to verify the effectiveness, the proposed method is applied to evolve neural controllers for the Cyber Rodent (CR) robot that has to switch properly between two distinctly different tasks: 1) protecting another moving robot by following it closely and 2) collecting objects scattered in the environment. Furthermore, the tasks and neural complexity are analyzed by including the neural structure as a separate objective function. The simulation and experimental results using the CR robot show that the multiobjective-based evolutionary method can be applied effectively for generating neural networks that enable the robot to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

This controller is optimally tuned to place the eigenvalues of the system well inside the unit circle and hence it guarantees stable operation over a wide range of input voltages. The design of the controller is based on the stability analysis of the system using the state transition matrix over a clock cycle. It is shown that the transition matrix across the switching manifold greatly influences the system's performance, allowing the system to be stabilized by periodically altering the manifold. The results are validated by analytical and numerical studies.

To study these issues, the thermal stability and electrical characteristics of MOS devices with clustered vertical furnace-grown, native oxide-free, ultrathin gate oxides and Hf xTayN metal gates were investigated. Postmetallization annealing (PMA) was carried out to study the metal-diffusion effects. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy analysis results show that the diffusion depths of Hf and Ta in the gate oxide are small and stay almost constant with a PMA temperature of up to 950 degC. Compared to those with conventional horizontal furnace-grown oxides, MOS devices with advanced clustered vertical furnace-grown gate oxides show excellent electrical characteristics, such as equivalent oxide thickness, hysteresis, interface trap density, stress-induced leakage current, defect generation rate, and stress-induced flat-band voltage shift. With an increase in PMA temperature, the electrical characteristics remain almost unchanged, which, in turn, achieve the excellent thermal stability and electrical reliabilities of MOS devices with clustered vertical furnace-grown gate oxides and Hf0.27Ta0.58N0.15 metal gates	$hbox{Hf}_{rm x}hbox{Ta}_{rm y}hbox{N}$;Clustered vertical furnace;MOS;metal gate;thermal stability,Annealing;Character generation;Electric variables;Hafnium;Hysteresis;Leakage current;MOS devices;Mass spectroscopy;Temperature;Thermal stability,MIS devices;hafnium compounds;secondary ion mass spectroscopy;semiconductor device metallisation;semiconductor device reliability;silicon compounds;tantalum compounds;thermal stability;time of flight mass spectroscopyHf0.27Ta0.58N0.15;SiO2;advanced MOS device application;clustered vertical furnace;defect generation rate;equivalent oxide thickness;hysteresis;interface trap density;metal gate;metal-diffusion effects;postmetallization annealing;stress-induced flat-band voltage shift;stress-induced leakage current;thermal stability;time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy analysis							
1083	The Influence of Experience and Information Search Styles on Project Risk Identification Performance	Maytorena, E.; Winch, G.M.; Freeman, J.; Kiely, T.	Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on	20070423	The management of risks in projects is a growing area of concern. Both the identification and analysis phases of the risk management process are considered the most important, for they can have a big effect on the precision of the risk assessment exercise. Currently, it is assumed that project managers rely largely on experience to identify project risks. These decisions, influenced by individual perception and attitudes, are made primarily under conditions of uncertainty. Understanding how individuals respond to uncertain situations, therefore, requires an understanding of how individuals intuitively assess the situation they perceive, before expressing a response. The Project Risk Identification (Pro-RIde) project interviewed 51 project managers using active information search (AIS) as a data collection method and cognitive mapping as a data-capturing tool. Our results suggest that the role of experience in the risk identification process is much less significant than it is commonly assumed to be. By contrast, information search style, level of education and risk management training do play a significant role in risk identification performance. These findings suggest the potential for a more thorough approach to risk identification	Active information search;cognitive mapping;project risk identification;project risk management,Best practices;Councils;Information management;Management training;Project management;Risk analysis;Risk management;Standards development;Uncertainty;Winches,education;project management;risk management;trainingAIS;Pro-Ride project;active information search;cognitive mapping;data collection method;data-capturing tool;education;information search styles;project managers;project risk identification performance;risk assessment exercise;risk management training

The focusing distance agrees with Rowlandﾒs theory. By optimizing the surface structures, the focused beam has a full wave at half maximum width of 1.6a. This suggests that the concave corrugated surface could substitute conventional optical lens for focusing and coupling subwavelength devices.

1088	Revisiting the Foundations of Artificial Immune Systems for Data Mining	Freitas, A.A.; Timmis, J.	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20070730	This paper advocates a problem-oriented approach for the design of artificial immune systems (AIS) for data mining. By problem-oriented approach we mean that, in real-world data mining applications the design of an AIS should take into account the characteristics of the data to be mined together with the application domain: the components of the AIS - such as its representation, affinity function, and immune process - should be tailored for the data and the application. This is in contrast with the majority of the literature, where a very generic AIS algorithm for data mining is developed and there is little or no concern in tailoring the components of the AIS for the data to be mined or the application domain. To support this problem-oriented approach, we provide an extensive critical review of the current literature on AIS for data mining, focusing on the data mining tasks of classification and anomaly detection. We discuss several important lessons to be taken from the natural immune system to design new AIS that are considerably more adaptive than current AIS. Finally, we conclude this paper with a summary of seven limitations of current AIS for data mining and ten suggested research directions.

1089	Design of Truncated Maximum Length Ternary Signals Where Their Squared Versions Have Uniform Even Harmonics	Ai Hui Tan	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20070515	The design of pseudo-random maximum length (PRML) ternary signals with properties suitable for identification of generalized quadratic Hammerstein models is considered. For such an application, it is desirable for the signal to have odd harmonics uniform and even harmonics suppressed, with its squared version having odd harmonics suppressed and even harmonics uniform. To date, the only class of signal known to possess such harmonic properties comprises of PRML ternary signals based on Galois field GF(3), and its extension fields. In this note, theoretical conditions for a PRML signal to possess these properties are derived and imposed on the design of signals based on higher odd fields to generate truncated PRML signals that fulfil the required specifications	Frequency domain design;Hammerstein models;maximum length signals;perturbation signals;pseudo-random signals;system identification,Electronic mail;Galois fields;Magnetic levitation;Signal design;Signal generators;Signal processing;Steel;Strips;System identification;Technological innovation,identification;signal processingGalois field;frequency domain design;generalized quadratic Hammerstein models;perturbation signals;pseudorandom maximum length;truncated maximum length ternary signals

Electronics Letters	20070220	The effects of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al2O3  passivation layer on AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on SiC were studied. Improved pulsed I-V characteristics and a relatively small decrease in the unity gain cutoff frequency (fT) and the maximum frequency of oscillation (fmax) were observed in the devices passivated using a 45 nm-thick ALD Al2O3 layer. For 0.12 mum gatelength devices, fT (fmax) decreased to 92 GHz (115 GHz) from 120 GHz (140 GHz), while for 0.25 mum devices, fT (fmax) decreased to 58 GHz (120 GHz) from 65 GHz (137 GHz). At a drain bias of 15 V, an output power of 3 W/mm with an associated gain of 5.0 dB and PAE of 33% were obtained for the 0.25 mum gatelength devices	alumina;aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;high electron mobility transistors;molecular beam epitaxial growth;passivation;silicon compounds92 to 140 GHz;Al2O3;AlGaN-GaN;HEMTs;SiC;atomic-layer-deposited passivation layer;frequency of oscillation;gain;pulsed I-V characteristics

Here, the authors report the measurement of the length-dependent thermal conductivities of individual SWCNTs on a Si substrate using a four-pad 3? method. An increase in thermal conductivity with length was observed at room temperature, which is consistent with a theoretical prediction that considers higher order three-phonon processes. When SWCNTs are longer than the phonon mean path, they showed dissipative thermal transport. The observed increase of thermal conductivity with length makes SWCNTs ideal for thermal management.	carbon nanotubes;phonons;thermal conductivity6322+m;7363Fg,

1094	Ontology Development for Designing and Managing Dynamic Business Process Networks	Therani, M.	Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on	20070529	Recent advances in flexible process design and deployment technologies, such as web services and flexible workflow systems, promise the development of flexible intra- and inter-organizational business process networks with potential economic benefits. However, exploiting this potential requires the development of scalable process-management technologies that provide a consistent viewpoint and common language (for describing properties of the process network) to all stakeholders involved in its management. Current approaches to managing such networks requires one to use a babel of languages (in the formal sense) at different levels of abstraction. The development of explicit process ontologies is one of the potentially viable approaches to provide an unified view. In this paper, we discuss the need for process ontologies, propose a task-based ontological framework synthesizing recent research in the fields of AI planning and software engineering, and illustrate the need to link declarative and procedural process representations. We illustrate the use of this ontological framework for managing processes in developing applications for integrating information from disparate information sources in multiple domains. Further, based on this experience, we discuss potential benefits and areas for future research.

1096	Subject Index		Autonomous Bidding Agents:Strategies and Lessons from the Trading Agent Competition	20120924	E-commerce increasingly provides opportunities for autonomous bidding agents: computer programs that bid in electronic markets without direct human intervention. Automated bidding strategies for an auction of a single good with a known valuation are fairly straightforward; designing strategies for simultaneous auctions with interdependent valuations is a more complex undertaking. This book presents algorithmic advances and strategy ideas within an integrated bidding agent architecture that have emerged from recent work in this fast-growing area of research in academia and industry. The authors analyze several novel bidding approaches that developed from the Trading Agent Competition (TAC), held annually since 2000. The benchmark challenge for competing agents--to buy and sell multiple goods with interdependent valuations in simultaneous auctions of different types--encourages competitors to apply innovative techniques to a common task. The book traces the evolution of TAC and follows selected agents from conception through several competitions, presenting and analyzing detailed algorithms developed for autonomous bidding. Autonomous Bidding Agents provides the first integrated treatment of methods in this rapidly developing domain of AI. The authors--who introduced TAC and created some of its most successful agents--offer both an overview of current research and new results. Michael P.

1102	Elastic waves in a fluid-loaded, semi-infinite axisymmetric rod	Yuhui Ai	Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, IEEE Transactions on	20070416	In a fluid-loaded, semi-infinite axisymmetric rod, a free shear stress boundary condition on the circular cross-sectional end introduces complicated, nondispersive waves in the solid. They are composed of a pulse wave, which has the same waveform as the transmitted one and travels at speed c1, and different kinds of pulse trains, each of which travels along the rod at the speed of either c1 or radic2c2, where c1 and c2 are the propagating speeds of the longitudinal and transversal bulk waves, respectively. Furthermore, one can conclude from the solutions to the boundary conditions that c1 and radic2c2 are the only phase speeds of nondispersive waves. Frequency equations associated with these waves are established, and the solutions are solved and discussed analytically and numerically. The acoustic field in the fluid is also fully discussed, and it is more complicated than a single outgoing Hankel function as described for an infinite rod. The acoustic energy coupling between the solid and the fluid and the end reflection and transmission are quantified as well. In the end, experimental examinations of the echo spectra, using an aluminum rod immersed in the water and air, fully confirm the numerical solutions to the frequency equations	,Acoustic propagation;Acoustic pulses;Aluminum;Boundary conditions;Couplings;Equations;Frequency;Solids;Stress;Temperature,acoustic waves;aluminium;rods (structures)Al;acoustic energy coupling;circular cross-sectional end;echo spectra;elastic waves;free shear stress boundary condition;frequency equations;nondispersive wave phase speeds;semi-infinite axisymmetric rod;single outgoing Hankel function

The 0.15-mum InAlAs/InGaAs p-HEMTs that were fabricated using the ALET exhibited improved Gm,max (1.38 S/mm), IONn/IOFF(1.18X104), drain-induced barrier lowering (80 mWV), threshold voltage uniformity (Vth,avg = -190 mV and alpha = 15 mV), and ftau (233 GHz), mainly due to the extremely low plasma-induced damage in the Schottky gate area.	$I_{rm ON}/I_{rm OFF}$ ratio;Atomic layer etching (ALET);drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL);pseudomorphic high-electron mobility transistor (p-HEMT);subthreshold slope,Artificial intelligence;Atomic layer deposition;Etching;HEMTs;Indium compounds;Indium gallium arsenide;MODFETs;PHEMTs;Plasma applications;Plasma properties,Schottky gate field effect transistors;high electron mobility transistors;indium compounds;sputter etchingALET;In0.52Al0.48As-In0.53Ga0.47As - Interface;RIE technology;Schottky gate;atomic layer etching;p-HEMT fabrication;plasma energy;pseudomorphic high-electron mobility transistor;reactive ion etching;size 0.15 mum;two-step recess process							
1108	Adaptive neuro-fuzzy module for inertial navigation system/global positioning system integration utilising position and velocity updates with real-time cross-validation	Noureldin, A.; El-Shafie, A.; El-Sheimy, N.	Radar, Sonar & Navigation, IET	20070910	Recently, methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been suggested to provide reliable positioning information for different land vehicle navigation applications. The majority of these applications utilise both the global positioning system (GPS) and the inertial navigation system (INS). These AI modules were trained to mimic the latest vehicle dynamics so that, in case of GPS outages, the system relies on INS and the recently updated AI module to provide the vehicle position. Several neural networks and neuro-fuzzy techniques were implemented in real-time in a de-centralised fashion and provided acceptable accuracy for short GPS outages. It was reported that these methods provided poor positioning accuracy during relatively long GPS outages. In order to prevail over this limitation, this study optimises the Al-based INS/GPS integration schemes utilising adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system with performing, in real-time, both GPS position and velocity updates. In addition, a holdout cross validation method during the update procedure was utilised in order to ensure generalisation of the model. The proposed system is tested using differential GPS and both navigational and tactical grades INS field test data obtained from a land vehicle experiment. The results showed that the effectiveness of the proposed system over both the existing Al-based and the conventional INS/GPS integration techniques, especially during long GPS outages. This method may have one limitation related to the unusual significant changes of the vehicle dynamics between the update and the prediction stages of operation which may influence the overall positioning accuracy.

1110	Compensation Scheme of Position Angle Errors of Permanent-Magnet Linear Motors	Zhang Dailin; Chen Youping; Kong Ching Tom; Ai Wu; Zhou Zude	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20070917	The position angle is very important in the current control of permanent-magnet linear motors (PMLMs), and its error affects the control precision of currents. However, the position angle is often not accurately detected because of faults in motor making, pulse loss of linear encoders, and so on. In order to precisely control the currents of PMLMs, a compensation scheme of position angle errors is proposed based on the mathematical relation between position angle errors and currents. In the scheme, a position angle error compensator is designed to compensate the position angles detected by linear encoders. Furthermore, a filter and a class of iteration learning algorithm are proposed to avoid the errors produced by detected phase currents and phase voltages. Simulation results show that position angle errors of PMLMs are fully compensated. Using the designed position angle error compensator, currents can be controlled in a more precise manner.

Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20070730	This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm based on artificial immune systems and ant colony optimization for distribution system reconfiguration, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The algorithm maintains a population of candidate solutions called antibodies. The search space is explored by means of the hypermutation operator that perturbs existing antibodies to produce new ones. A table of pheromones is used to reinforce better edges during hypermutation. An added innovation is the use of the pheromones to obtain quick solutions to restore the distribution system under contingency situations. The hybrid approach has been successfully implemented on two test networks. The results obtained demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm.

1116	Design of Generalized PI Observers for Descriptor Linear Systems	Ai-Guo Wu; Guang-Ren Duan	Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, IEEE Transactions on	20061211	The new type of generalized proportional integral (GPI) observers for descriptor linear systems is proposed. Based on a complete parametric solution to a type of generalized Sylvester matrix equations, a parametric approach for the design of the GPI observers is established. The proposed approach gives parameterizations of all the observer gain matrices in terms of some free parameters which represent the degrees of design freedom. Moreover, the parametric expression of the corresponding finite left eigenvector matrix of the observer system is also presented. The proposed approach, which guarantees the regularity of the observer system, realizes the elimination of impulsive behaviors of the observer system. The proposed design method offers all the degrees of design freedom which can be further utilized to achieve additional specifications and performances.

1117	Generating Ambient Behaviors in Computer Role-Playing Games	Cutumisu, M.; Szafron, D.; Schaeffer, Jonathan; McNaughton, M.; Roy, T.; Onuczko, C.; Carbonaro, M.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20061002	To compete in today's market, companies that develop computer role-playing games (CRPGs) must quickly and reliably create realistic, engaging game stories. Indeed, intricate storylines and realism that goes beyond graphics have become major product differentiators. To establish both, it's essential that companies use AI to create nonplayer characters (NPCs) that exhibit near-realistic ambient behaviors. Doing so offers players a rich background tapestry that makes the game more entertaining. Because storylines must come first, however, NPCs that aren't critical to the plot are often added at the end of the game development cycle - if resources are available. To control NPCs' ambient behaviors, many computer games use custom scripts. Story authors must therefore write computer code fragments for the game world's hundreds or thousands of NPCs. Our approach lets game authors use generative behavior patterns to create scripts of complex NPC behaviors and interactions. To build these patterns; they use our publicly available ScriptEase tool, which lets them create game stories using a high-level, menu-driven programming model	ambient behavior;collaborative behavior;computer games;generative pattern;intelligent agents;nonplayer character;scripting language,Artificial intelligence;Collaborative work;Computer graphics;Engines;Intelligent systems;Power generation;Programming profession;Robustness;World Wide Web;Writing,artificial intelligence;authoring languages;computer animation;computer games;entertainment;humanities;interactive systems;user interfacesNPC ambient behaviors;ScriptEase tool;artificial intelligence;computer role-playing games;custom scripts;game development cycle;game stories;high-level menu-driven programming model;nonplayer characters

1121	Rule generation for protein secondary structure prediction with support vector machines and decision tree	Jieyue He; Hae-Jin Hu; Harrison, R.; Tai, P.C.; Yi Pan	NanoBioscience, IEEE Transactions on	20060306	"Support vector machines (SVMs) have shown strong generalization ability in a number of application areas, including protein structure prediction. However, the poor comprehensibility hinders the success of the SVM for protein structure prediction. The explanation of how a decision made is important for accepting the machine learning technology, especially for applications such as bioinformatics. The reasonable interpretation is not only useful to guide the ""wet experiments,"" but also the extracted rules are helpful to integrate computational intelligence with symbolic AI systems for advanced deduction. On the other hand, a decision tree has good comprehensibility. In this paper, a novel approach to rule generation for protein secondary structure prediction by integrating merits of both the SVM and decision tree is presented. This approach combines the SVM with decision tree into a new algorithm called SVM_DT, which proceeds in three steps. This algorithm first trains an SVM. Then, a new training set is generated through careful selection from the output of the SVM. Finally, the obtained training set is used to train a decision tree learning system and to extract the corresponding rule sets. The results of the experiments of protein secondary structure prediction on RS126 data set show that the comprehensibility of SVM_DT is much better than that of the SVM. Moreover, the generalization ability of SVM_DT is better than that of C4.5 decision trees and is similar to that of the SVM. Hence, SVM_DT can be used not only for prediction, but also for guiding biological experiments"	Decision tree;protein structure;rule extraction;support vector machine (SVM),Bioinformatics;Computer science;Decision trees;Helium;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Proteins;Scholarships;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines,biology computing;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;proteins;support vector machinesAI;SVM_DT;bioinformatics;comprehensibility;computational intelligence;decision tree;machine learning;protein secondary structure prediction;rule generation;support vector machines

Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	[100]-tilt grain boundary Josephson junctions with misorientation of the c-axis directions have been fabricated using epitaxial (Hg0.9Re0.1)Ba2CaCu2Oy [(Hg,Re)-1212] thin films grown on SrTiO3 bicrystal substrates. Two types of the [100]-tilt junctions, that is, the mountain-type junction and the valley-type junction, of which a-b planes formed a mountain shape and a valley shape along the grain boundaries, respectively, were examined for various misorientation angles (?). Both the types of junctions showed resistively shunted junction-type current-voltage (I-V) characteristics with relatively high characteristic voltages in a wide temperature range from 4.2ﾠtoﾠ110ﾠK. The valley-type junctions exhibited properties superior to those for the mountain-type junctions, such as very low excess current and much homogeneous current distribution, which is attributed to different film growth mode near the grain boundaries. They also exhibited the products of the critical current (Ic) and the normal-state resistance (Rn) as high as 3.0ﾖ4.2, 1.0ﾖ1.4, and 0.2ﾖ0.4ﾠmV at 4.2, 77, and 100ﾠK, respectively. The misorientation angle dependences of junction parameters for the [100]-tilt junctions were compared with those for conventional [001]-tilt junctions with misorientation of the a-b plane directions. The Rn and the IcRn products for the [1- 00]-tilt junctions were substantially larger than those for the [001]-tilt junctions. Large hysteresis in the magnetic-field dependence of Ic was observed for the applied field larger than a certain threshold value, suggesting flux penetration between the CuO2 planes.

Electronics Letters	20060619	Ternary pseudorandom signals with uniform spectra are useful for system identification, particularly during prototyping when actuators are rather primitive. To reduce the effect of nonlinear distortion on the linear estimate, the signal should have harmonic multiples of two and three suppressed. No analytical method is currently available for the design of such signals, while optimisation cannot guarantee an optimal solution. An analytical method that guarantees optimality is introduced in which the pseudorandom signal, generated from a Galois field, is designed based on a primitive version of the signal having suitable harmonic properties and a sparse spectrum with multiple periodicity.

1132	Band gap optimization of finite photonic structures using apodization method	Wu, Jiu Hui; Liu, A.Q.; Ang, L.K.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	In this paper, the photonic band diagram and the density of states in finite photonic structures are analyzed and optimized for broad bandwidths using the apodization method. Based on the effective propagation constant, the group refractive index can be computed for the finite structures, which is adopted to reveal the physical explanation on the optimal band gaps. The surface states of the finite photonic crystal and the mode matching at the interfaces are also considered. It is found that the high group index of the photonic structures can obtain broad bandwidths and also enhance the mode matching at the interfaces. By slowly varying the radii of the cylinders monotonously in two dimensions, the first band gap can be increased from 10.6% to 20.04%. This work provides a useful tool for the optimal design of finite photonic crystals.	electronic density of states;photonic band gap;photonic crystals;refractive index;spectral line breadth;surface states4270Qs;7320At;7820Ci,							
1133	Self-Latched Micromachined Mechanism With Large Displacement Ratio	Liu, A.Q.; Li, J.; Liu, Z.; Lu, C.; Zhang, X.M.; Wang, M.Y.	Microelectromechanical Systems, Journal of	20061204	A self-latched micromachined mechanism with large displacement ratio is presented in this paper. The large output displacement is obtained by amplifying the small input motion through the elastic deformation of the compliant configuration, which realizes the self-latched output by local bifurcation effect. The design theory and synthesis of compliant microstructures are analyzed. The numerical and analytical simulations are implemented to the linear amplification, which shows that as high as >50 times displacement magnification can be obtained. Self-latching is realized by bifurcation effect to maintain fixed output displacement even though the input goes further as indicated by the large displacement simulation. This micromachined mechanism along with a comb-drive actuator is fabricated by deep-reactive ion-etching (DRIE) process. In experiment, it measures an output displacement of 52.0 mum at an input displacement of only 0.96 mum, obtaining a displacement ratio of 54.2. For further input displacement, the output displacement remains unchanged, proving the self-latching effect	Bifurcation effect;large displacement ratio;micromachined mechanism;self-latching,Actuators;Analytical models;Bifurcation;Displacement measurement;Fingers;Micromechanical devices;Microstructure;Numerical simulation;Piezoelectric materials;Shape memory alloys,amplification;bifurcation;elastic deformation;micromachining;micromechanical devices;numerical analysis;sputter etchingDRIE;comb-drive actuator;deep-reactive ion-etching;elastic deformation;large displacement ratio;large displacement simulation;local bifurcation effect;micromachined mechanism;self-latching

1135	Analysis of key parameters affecting the thermal behavior and performance of quantum cascade lasers	Zhu, Cheng; Yong-gang Zhang; Ai-zhen Li; Tian, Zhao-bing	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	In this paper, we present an investigation of some key parameters affecting the thermal behavior and performance of quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). We take into account the temperature dependent heat conducting parameters of the layers, including their interface thermal resistance. Our study shows that for QCL structures with a rather thick active core comprised of many heterointerfaces, the thermal boundary resistances play a crucial role. We use a finite element method to simulate the heat dissipation in QCLs with different structures and different packaging methods. These are then quantitatively compared with existing experimental data. Results show that (1) epilayer-up mounting with buried and/or thick gold plated structures is a good substitute for epilayer-down mounting, and (2) using InP cladding and plasmon layer replacing InAlAs/InGaAs further improves heat transfer characteristics. On the other hand, for reaching cw operation at room temperature, the driving current density must be optimized to a significantly lower level than what is conventionally believed. The simulations also reveal that the substantial nonuniformity of temperature distribution in the active core of QCLs should have a significant effect on the resulting laser spectra. In this paper, we also present investigations and discussions on the thermal performance of InGaAs/AlGaAsSb QCLs and its correlations to various parameters.

1140	Making Sense of Requirements, Sooner	Menzies, T.; Richardson, J.	Computer	20061009	Making decisions during early requirements formulations is like racing through a dark forest without a road map or compass. The available options or goals are often unclear. Different participants in the formulation process have different points of view and frequently end up making decisions based on political rather than technical grounds. Using AI-based simulation tools can cut back the forest to reveal clear paths to possibilities and useful requirements. Researchers have long used modeling and simulation to analyze complex processes. In this approach, we describe the system's properties and behavior symbolically and numerically, and then let the computer unleash its brute force to grind through the combinations. We have been developing our own model-based technique for making early requirements decisions. The technique uses two curious properties seen in many models, clumps and collars, which make it easier to search quickly through a seemingly vast range of options	requirements modeling;software technologies,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Cost function;Encoding;Patient monitoring;Probability distribution;Runtime;Space exploration;Uncertainty,decision making;digital simulation;formal specificationAI-based simulation tool;decision making;requirements analysis

1142	Multiprocessor scheduling and rescheduling with use of cellular automata and artificial immune system support	Swiecicka, A.; Seredynski, F.; Zomaya, A.Y.	Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20060130	The paper presents cellular automata (CA)-based multiprocessor scheduling system, in which an extraction of knowledge about scheduling process occurs and this knowledge is used while solving new instances of the scheduling problem. There are three modes of the scheduler: learning, normal operating, and reusing. In the learning mode, a genetic algorithm is used to discover CA rules suitable for solving instances of a scheduling problem. In the normal operating mode, discovered rules are able to find automatically, without a calculation of a cost function, an optimal or suboptimal solution of the scheduling problem for any initial allocation of program tasks in a multiprocessor system. In the third mode, previously discovered rules are reused with support of an artificial immune system (AIS) to solve new instances of the problem. We present a number of experimental results showing the performance of the CA-based scheduler.

Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part A: Systems and Humans, IEEE Transactions on	20051219	The human immune system is a complex system of cells, molecules, tissues, and diverse organs that can provide us with primary defense against pathogenic organisms. These components are highly interactive and execute the immune response in a coordinated and specific manner. This paper presents a formal mathematical model of an artificial immune system (AIS)-based control framework. The framework aims to provide an integrated solution to control and coordinate complex distributed systems with a large number of autonomous agents such as automated warehouses, distribution centers, and automated material-handling systems. The control framework consists of a set of AIS agents working in response to the changing environment and the occurrence of tasks. The AIS agents manipulate their capabilities to derive appropriate responses to tackle different problems. A methodology describing the response-manipulation algorithm of the AIS agents and their ability to generate new capabilities is discussed in this paper. Through response manipulation and knowledge building, a self-organized and fully distributed system with agents that are able to adapt and accommodate in a dynamic environment via distributed decision making and interagent communication is achieved.

1145	Collective Intelligence: It's All in the Numbers	Jones, K.S.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20060530	AI has been an exporter of ideas to computing in general (neural networks, agents, though robotics is more complex). But AI is now embracing ideas from elsewhere that were initially scorned because they were thought to have nothing to do with modeling intelligence and, especially, human intelligence.

1146	RF MEMS switch integrated on printed circuit board with metallic membrane first sequence and transferring	Zhang, Q.X.; Yu, A.B.; Guo, L.H.; Kumar, R.; Teoh, K.W.; Liu, A.Q.; Lo, G. -Q; Kwong, D. -L	Electron Device Letters, IEEE	20060626	This letter reports, for the first time, on RF MEMS switches integrated on flexible printed circuit boards (i.e., FR-4) using transfer technology. The devices were first processed on Si-substrate using a modified MEMS sequence and subsequently transferred onto an FR-4 substrate by thermal compressive bonding, mechanical grinding, and wet removal of silicon. The switches were demonstrated with flat metal membrane (top electrode), precisely controlled gap between the membrane and bottom electrode, low insertion loss (? 0.15 dB at 20 GHz), and high isolation (? 21 dB at 20 GHz). This technology shows the potential to monolithically integrate RF MEMS components with other RF devices on organic substrate for RF system implementation.

The layered artificial intelligence (AI) architecture presented is based on the subsumption architecture, a proven control system for mobile robots that consists of parallel levels of independent behaviors. Higher-level behaviors modules can subsume lower-level ones through the limited number of inputs and outputs. This AI system can be highly optimized and extended various ways. A C++ program is presented demonstrating simple three-layer AI agents.

1152	A Semantic Future for AI	Studer, R.; Ankolekar, A.; Hitzler, P.; Sure, Y.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20060807	In our modern information society, people need to manage ever-increasing numbers of personal devices and conduct more of their work and activities online, often using heterogeneous services. The amount of information each individual has to process is constantly growing, making this information increasingly difficult to control, channel, share, and constructively use. To mitigate this, computing must become much more human centered - for example, by presenting personalized information to users and by respecting personal preferences when controlling multiple devices or invoking various services. Appropriate representation of the information's semantics and of the functionality of devices and services are critical to such personalized computing. Symbolic artificial intelligence techniques provide the method of choice for the required semantic-representation and reasoning capabilities. The challenge for symbolic AI is to support large-scale, distributed, dynamic knowledge bases enabling highly adaptive and evolving systems. AI must also look to specific application contexts and develop real-world solutions for problems in those domains.

1157	Modulational transparency and femtosecond pulse train in Bragg reflectors with time-varying dielectric constant	Wu, Jiu Hui; Cheng, T. -H; Liu, A.Q.; Wang, Y.X.	Applied Physics Letters	20090618	A theoretical study is conducted to investigate the nonlinear properties of a one-dimensional (1D) periodic stratified structure with time-varying dielectric constants. When the dielectric constant is modulated temporally, the distributed Bragg reflector exhibits different throughputs depending on the modulation amplitude. Below or at the critical value, a periodic and stable femtosecond pulse train is generated; above this critical value, the modulational transparency is observed, as the reflectivity decreases rapidly, so that all incident radiation is completely transferred through the layered media. When the layer number is up to 15, the pulse train generated at the critical value is periodic with perfect reflectivity and zero rejection. These excellent optical properties may enhance the potential applications of the 1D periodic stratified structure in optical switches and laser optics.	distributed Bragg reflectors;inhomogeneous media;nonlinear optics;optical modulation;optical pulse generation;periodic structures;permittivity;reflectivity;transparency4265Re;4279Bh,

Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on	20051227	Context-aware computing describes the situation where a wearable/mobile computer is aware of its user's state and surroundings and modifies its behavior based on this information. We designed, implemented, and evaluated a wearable system which can learn context-dependent personal preferences by identifying individual user states and observing how the user interacts with the system in these states. This learning occurs online and does not require external supervision. The system relies on techniques from machine learning and statistical analysis. A case study integrates the approach in a context-aware mobile phone. The results indicate that the method is able to create a meaningful user context model while only requiring data from comfortable wearable sensor devices.

1159	The ultrafast excitation processes in femtosecond laser-induced damage in dielectric omnidirectional reflectors	Jia, T.Q.; Sun, H.Y.; Li, X.X.; Feng, D.H.; Li, C.B.; Xu, S.Z.; Li, R.X.; Xu, Z.Z.; Kuroda, H.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	A pump and probe system is developed, where the probe pulse duration ? is less than 60ﾠfs while the pump pulse is stretched up to 150ﾖ670ﾠfs. The time-resolved excitation processes and damage mechanisms in the omnidirectional reflectors SiO2/TiO2 and ZnS/MgF2 are studied. It is found that as the pump pulse energy is higher than the threshold value, the reflectivity of the probe pulse decreases rapidly during the former half, rather than around the peak of the pump pulse. A coupled dynamic model based on the avalanche ionization (AI) theory is used to study the excitation processes in the sample and its inverse influences on the pump pulse. The results indicate that as pulse duration is longer than 150ﾠfs, photoionization (PI) and AI both play important roles in the generation of conduction band electrons (CBEs); the CBE density generated via AI is higher than that via PI by a factor of 102ﾖ104. The theory explains well the experimental results about the ultrafast excitation processes and the threshold fluences.	conduction bands;dielectric devices;high-speed optical techniques;laser beam effects;mirrors;photoexcitation;photoionisation;reflectivity4265Re;4279Bh;6180Ba,

The Curie temperature of PSZT films decreases with the increase of Sr contents and paraelectric PSZT films at room temperature are demonstrated as x approaches 0.4. The increase of Sr contents also leads to the simultaneous decrease of dielectric constant, tunability, and dielectric loss. The composition dependence of Curie temperature and tunability can be attributed to the shrinkage of crystal lattice due to a Sr addition. PSZT films with x=0.6 show the largest figure of merit of 24 with a moderate tunability of 48% and a dielectric loss of 0.02. This suggests that Sr-modified PZT is a potential candidate for voltage tunable applications.	dielectric losses;ferroelectric Curie temperature;ferroelectric thin films;lead compounds;permittivity;sol-gel processing;strontium compounds7722Ch;7755+f;7780Bh;7784Dy;8120Fw,							
1161	Dynamic magnetization processes in magnetostrictive amorphous wires	Chen, A.P.; Zhukov, A.; Gonzalez, J.; Dominguez, L.; Blanco, J.M.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	We have performed the theoretical studies on the longitudinal dynamic magnetization process of magnetostrictive amorphous wires characterized by a large single Barkhausen jump (magnetic bistability) based on our previous experimental measurements on these wires. The domain structures of these wire samples consist of a single domain inner core with axial magnetization surrounded by the outer domain shell with the magnetization oriented perpendicular (?s?0) or circular (?s?0) to the wire axis. In the present work we use the resultant magnetization vector M? tilting ? angle to z axis to describe the sampleﾒs domain structures. In terms of solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation followed by M? the analytical solution of the dimensionless axial component of the magnetization mz=MZ/Ms has been obtained, and mz[t(H0,fe),?,?] is a function of the field amplitude H0, field frequency fe, and the samplesﾒ material parameters such as the damping constant ? and the gyromagnetic ratio ?. The function mz[t(H0,fe),?,?] allows us to study the dynamic properties of the magnetization process of a wire sample. It has been found that the switching time ts, the switching field Hsw, and the dynamic coercive field Hdc depend on a magnetic field and material parameters. We found that the parameter ?=&#x3b- 3;?/(1+?2) related to the rate of M?, rotating the direction of the effective field, plays an important role in the magnetization process. By fitting the experimental data to the theoretical magnetization curve the value of the damping constant ? of the magnetostrictive amorphous wires can be estimated.

1163	Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Interaction in Virtual Reality Art	Lugrin, J.-L.; Cavazza, M.; Crooks, S.; Palmer, M.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20061002	In entertainment applications, artificial intelligence techniques have most often been used to implement embodied agents or to automatically generate artistic content. A more recent development concerns using AI to support the user experience through new AI-based interactivity techniques. This is especially of interest for the development of artistic installations based on interactive 3D worlds. A major difficulty in developing such installations is to properly translate the artistic intention into actual elements of interactivity, which in turn determine the user experience. The starting point of this research was to facilitate the description of high-level behaviors for virtual worlds that would form part of virtual reality (VR) art installations. In our approach to interactivity, the consequences of user interaction can be dynamically computed to produce cascaded effects eliciting a specific kind of user experience. This chain of events is computed from first principles embedding elements of the artistic brief (the artist's initial conceptual description of the interactive installation and the intended user experience). In other words, AI techniques are used for their ability to represent actions and to compute analogical transformations on them to create a user experience	artificial intelligence;causal perception;immersive displays;virtual reality art,Art;Artificial intelligence;Discrete event simulation;Engines;Intelligent agent;Physics;Synthetic aperture sonar;Virtual environment;Virtual reality;Visualization,art;artificial intelligence;entertainment;virtual realityAl-based interactivity techniques;artificial intelligence-mediated interaction;artistic installations;entertainment applications;virtual reality art

It was found that the breakdown voltage flying over a 30-nm-high asperity was as low as 1.4 V, a 50% reduction compared with a smooth disk without the asperity. Also, the read sensor was easily damaged physically and magnetically when breakdown occurred while flying over the asperity. It is concluded that the inclusion of asperities in electrical breakdown testing is critically important in determining the lowest breakdown voltage and assessing the likelihood of damage to the sensor	Asperity;electrical breakdown;electrostatic discharge (ESD);head-disk interface,Breakdown voltage;Current measurement;Disk recording;Electric breakdown;Electrostatic discharge;Giant magnetoresistance;Hard disks;Magnetic heads;Magnetic sensors;Testing,electrostatic discharge;giant magnetoresistance;hard discs;magnetic heads;magnetic recordingasperity;electrical breakdown testing;electrostatic discharge breakdown;hard disk;head disk interface;read sensor;recording head

1166	Making Sense of Sensemaking 2: A Macrocognitive Model	Klein, G.; Moon, B.; Hoffman, R.R.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20061002	For pt.1 see ibid., vol.21, no.4, p. 70-73 (2006). In this paper, we have laid out a theory of sensemaking that might be useful for intelligent systems applications. It's a general, empirically grounded account of sensemaking that goes significantly beyond the myths and puts forward some nonobvious, testable hypotheses about the process. When people try to make sense of events, they begin with some perspective, viewpoint, or framework - however minimal. For now, let's use a metaphor and call this a frame. We can express frames in various meaningful forms, including stories, maps, organizational diagrams, or scripts, and can use them in subsequent and parallel processes. Even though frames define what count as data, they themselves actually shape the data Furthermore, frames change as we acquire data. In other words, this is a two-way street: Frames shape and define the relevant data, and data mandate that frames change in nontrivial ways. We examine five areas of empirical findings: causal reasoning, commitment to hypotheses, feedback and learning, sense-making as a skill, and confirmation bias. In each area the Data/Frame model, and the research it's based on, doesn't align with common beliefs. For that reason, the Data/Frame model cannot be considered a depiction of commonsense views	causal reasoning;confirmation bias;fixation bias;frames;inference-making;mental models,Cognition;Costs;Decision making;Feedback;Game theory;Human computer interaction;Intelligent systems;Machine intelligence;Moon;Testing,cognitive systems;learning (artificial intelligence)AI learning;Data-Frame model;causal reasoning;confirmation bias;feedback;intelligent systems applications;macrocognitive model;sensemaking theory

Computer Graphics and Applications, IEEE	20060501	In this article, we report on the emergent narrative concept aiming at the definition of a narrative theory adapted to the VR medium (whether a game or VR application). The inherent freedom of movement proper to VR - an indisputable element of immersion - collides with the Aristotelian vision of articulated plot events with respect to the given timeline associated with the story in display. This narrative paradox can only be observed in interactive VR applications and it doesn't seem possible to resolve it through the use of existing narrative theories. Interactivity is the novel element that storytellers must address.

1170	Normal and Pathological NCAT Image and Phantom Data Based on Physiologically Realistic Left Ventricle Finite-Element Models	Veress, A.I.; Segars, W.P.; Weiss, J.A.; Tsui, B.M.W.; Gullberg, G.T.	Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on	20061130	The four-dimensional (4-D) NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom, which provides a realistic model of the normal human anatomy and cardiac and respiratory motions, is used in medical imaging research to evaluate and improve imaging devices and techniques, especially dynamic cardiac applications. One limitation of the phantom is that it lacks the ability to accurately simulate altered functions of the heart that result from cardiac pathologies such as coronary artery disease (CAD). The goal of this work was to enhance the 4-D NCAT phantom by incorporating a physiologically based, finite-element (FE) mechanical model of the left ventricle (LV) to simulate both normal and abnormal cardiac motions. The geometry of the FE mechanical model was based on gated high-resolution X-ray multislice computed tomography (MSCT) data of a healthy male subject. The myocardial wall was represented as a transversely isotropic hyperelastic material, with the fiber angle varying from -90deg at the epicardial surface, through 0deg at the midwall, to 90deg at the endocardial surface. A time-varying elastance model was used to simulate fiber contraction, and physiological intraventricular systolic pressure-time curves were applied to simulate the cardiac motion over the entire cardiac cycle. To demonstrate the ability of the FE mechanical model to accurately simulate the normal cardiac motion as well as the abnormal motions indicative of CAD, a normal case and two pathologic cases were simulated and analyzed. In the first pathologic model, a subendocardial anterior ischemic region was defined. A second model was created with a transmural ischemic region defined in the same location. The FE-based deformations were incorporated into the 4-D NCAT cardiac model through the control points that define the cardiac structures in the phantom which were set to move according to the predictions of the mechanical model. A simulation study was performed using the FE-NCAT combination to investigate how- - the differences in contractile function between the subendocardial and transmural infarcts manifest themselves in myocardial Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images. The normal FE model produced strain distributions that were consistent with those reported in the literature and a motion consistent with that defined in the normal 4-D NCAT beating heart model based on tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The addition of a subendocardial ischemic region changed the average transmural circumferential strain from a contractile value of -0.09 to a tensile value of 0.02. The addition of a transmural ischemic region changed average circumferential strain to a value of 0.13, which is consistent with data reported in the literature. Model results demonstrated differences in contractile function between subendocardial and transmural infarcts and how these differences in function are documented in simulated myocardial SPECT images produced using the 4-D NCAT phantom. Compared with the original NCAT beating heart model, the FE mechanical model produced a more accurate simulation for the cardiac motion abnormalities. Such a model, when incorporated into the 4-D NCAT phantom, has great potential for use in cardiac imaging research. With its enhanced physiologically based cardiac model, the 4-D NCAT phantom can be used to simulate realistic, predictive imaging data of a patient population with varying whole-body anatomy and with varying healthy and diseased states of the heart that will provide a known truth from which to evaluate and improve existing and emerging 4-D imaging techniques used in the diagnosis of cardiac disease	Cardiac imaging research;NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT);SPECT phantom;finite element (FE);ischemia;left ventricle;mechanical model,Computational modeling;Coronary arteriosclerosis;Finite element methods;Heart;Imaging phantoms;Iron;Magnetic field induced strain;Myocardium;Pathology;Predictive models,biomedical MRI;blood vessels;cardiology;deformation;diseases;finite element analysis;haemodynamics;phantoms;physiological models;single photon emission computed tomographySPECT;average transmural circumferential strain;cardiac motion;coronary artery disease;deformations;epicardial surface;fiber contraction;finite-element mechanical model;four-dimensional NURBS-based cardiac-torso phantom;gated high-resolution X-ray multislice computed tomography;heart;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging;myocardial wall;normal NCAT image;normal human anatomy;pathological NCAT image;physiological intraventricular systolic pressure-time curves;physiologically realistic left ventricle finite element models;respiratory motion;single photon emission computed tomography images;strain distributions;subendocardial anterior ischemic region;subendocardial infarcts;subendocardial ischemic region;time-varying elastance model;transmural infarcts;transmural ischemic region;transversely isotropic hyperelastic materialAlgorithms;Artifacts;Computer Simulation;Finite Element Analysis;Heart Ventricles;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Anatomic;Models, Cardiovascular;Movement;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Ventricular Dysfunction, Left

1172	New Load Modeling Approaches Based on Field Tests for Fast Transient Stability Calculations	Qian Ai; Danzhen Gu; Chen Chen	Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20061030	The load models play an important role in the simulation and evaluation of power systems performance. This paper first proposes a new load model, which is based on a particular form of artificial neural networks we denote as adaptive back-propagation (ABP) network for nonparametric models. ABP can overcome some shortcomings of common back-propagation (BP), and the ABP load models offer several advantages over traditional load models as they are nonstructural and can be derived quickly. The application of the method is illustrated using actual field test data from Northeast China to Shanghai, one of the biggest cities in China. The load models so obtained are shown to replicate the test measurements more closely than those based on traditional load models. Second, extension of the method to the determination of the parameters of the traditional load models is also proposed. It is based on a linear back-propagation (LBP) network. The proposed LBP for parametric load model is incorporated in a transient stability program to show that not only the computational time is significantly reduced, but also the accuracy of identification is improved	Adaptive back-propagation (ABP) networks;artificial neural networks;field tests;linear back-propagation (LBP) networks;load modeling;transient stability,Artificial neural networks;Differential equations;Load management;Load modeling;Power system modeling;Power system simulation;Power system stability;Power system transients;System testing;Transformers,backpropagation;neural nets;power system analysis computing;power system interconnection;power system transient stability;testingNortheast China;Shanghai;adaptive backpropagation network;artificial neural network;field tests;linear backpropagation network;load modeling approaches;transient stability calculations

1174	An unsupervised artificial immune classifier for multi/hyperspectral remote sensing imagery	Yanfei Zhong; Liangpei Zhang; Bo Huang; Pingxiang Li	Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on	20060123	A new method in computational intelligence namely artificial immune systems (AIS), which draw inspiration from the vertebrate immune system, have strong capabilities of pattern recognition. Even though AIS have been successfully utilized in several fields, few applications have been reported in remote sensing. Modern commercial imaging satellites, owing to their large volume of high-resolution imagery, offer greater opportunities for automated image analysis. Hence, we propose a novel unsupervised machine-learning algorithm namely unsupervised artificial immune classifier (UAIC) to perform remote sensing image classification. In addition to their nonlinear classification properties, UAIC possesses biological properties such as clonal selection, immune network, and immune memory. The implementation of UAIC comprises two steps: initially, the first clustering centers are acquired by randomly choosing from the input remote sensing image. Then, the classification task is carried out. This assigns each pixel to the class that maximizes stimulation between the antigen and the antibody. Subsequently, based on the class, the antibody population is evolved and the memory cell pool is updated by immune algorithms until the stopping criterion is met. The classification results are evaluated by comparing with four known algorithms: K-means, ISODATA, fuzzy K-means, and self-organizing map. It is shown that UAIC is an adaptive clustering algorithm, which outperforms other algorithms in all the three experiments we carried out.

1175	Prosody conversion from neutral speech to emotional speech	Jianhua Tao; Yongguo Kang; Aijun Li	Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, IEEE Transactions on	20060619	"Emotion is an important element in expressive speech synthesis. Unlike traditional discrete emotion simulations, this paper attempts to synthesize emotional speech by using ""strong"", ""medium"", and ""weak"" classifications. This paper tests different models, a linear modification model (LMM), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and a classification and regression tree (CART) model. The linear modification model makes direct modification of sentence F0 contours and syllabic durations from acoustic distributions of emotional speech, such as, F0 topline, F0 baseline, durations, and intensities. Further analysis shows that emotional speech is also related to stress and linguistic information. Unlike the linear modification method, the GMM and CART models try to map the subtle prosody distributions between neutral and emotional speech. While the GMM just uses the features, the CART model integrates linguistic features into the mapping. A pitch target model which is optimized to describe Mandarin F0 contours is also introduced. For all conversion methods, a deviation of perceived expressiveness (DPE) measure is created to evaluate the expressiveness of the output speech. The results show that the LMM gives the worst results among the three methods. The GMM method is more suitable for a small training set, while the CART method gives the better emotional speech output if trained with a large context-balanced corpus. The methods discussed in this paper indicate ways to generate emotional speech in speech synthesis. The objective and subjective evaluation processes are also analyzed. These results support the use of a neutral semantic content text in databases for emotional speech synthesis"	Emotional speech;prosody analysis;speech synthesis,Acoustic testing;Classification tree analysis;Information analysis;Jitter;Regression tree analysis;Spatial databases;Speech analysis;Speech processing;Speech synthesis;Stress,Gaussian processes;linguistics;regression analysis;speech synthesis;trees (mathematics)Gaussian mixture model;Mandarin F0 contours;acoustic distribution;classification and regression tree model;deviation of perceived expressiveness;emotion speech;emotional speech generation;expressive speech synthesis;linear modification model;neutral semantic content text;neutral speech;pitch target model;prosody conversion;speech databases

1177	A robust method for spike sorting with automatic overlap decomposition	Guang-Li Wang; Yi Zhou; Ai-Hua Chen; Pu-Ming Zhang; Pei-Ji Liang	Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20060605	Spike sorting is the mandatory first step in analyzing multiunit recording signals for studying information processing mechanisms within the nervous system. Extracellular recordings usually contain overlapped spikes produced by a number of neurons adjacent to the electrode, together with unknown background noise, which in turn induce some difficulties in neural signal identification. In this paper, we propose a robust method to deal with these problems, which employs an automatic overlap decomposition technique based on the relaxation algorithm that requires simple fast Fourier transforms. The performance of the presented system was tested at various signal-to-noise ratio levels based on synthetic data that were generated from real recordings.

1178	Synthesized processing techniques for monolithic integration of nanometer-scale hole type photonic band gap crystal with micrometer-scale microelectromechanical structures	Teo, S.H.G.; Liu, A.Q.; Yu, M.B.; Singh, J.	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures	20090618	This article reports the synthesized fabrication process design and module development that enabled the monolithic integration of deep submicrometer size, two dimensional hole-type photonic band gap crystals (PhCs) with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) actuators and optical testing structures (OTS). Techniques enabling sublithographic wavelength patterning using only conventional chrome-on-glass binary photomasks without phase shift features were achieved through the manipulation of mask bias designs and the partial coherence control of the lithographic exposure system. Together with the development of time multiplexed reactive ion etching and focus ion beam milling techniques, such design of the process allows the realization of highly dense PhC and MEMS actuators physically released from the buried oxide layer. Here, disparate pattern dimensions [with PhC critical dimensions (CDs) of only 175ﾠnm, MEMS typical dimensions of 2ﾠ?m, and OTS openings more than 400ﾠ?m wide], varied etch depth (3ﾠ?m for the PhC and MEMS, 61ﾠ?m for the OTS), and the requirement of a sufficient process latitude for exposure and etch processes are some of the key challenges that were overcome for a successful integration of air-bridge-type PhC CDs with movable MEMS actuators. Hence, the works described in this article enable MEMS tunable PhC properties with potential application in next generation dynamic optical communication networks and photonic integrated circuits.	focused ion beam technology;masks;microactuators;photonic band gap;photonic crystals;sputter etching0710Cm;8116Nd;8165Cf,

Computational Intelligence Magazine, IEEE	20070319	During the last decade, the field of artificial immune system (A1S) is progressing slowly and steadily as a branch of computational intelligence (CI). There has been increasing interest in the development of computational models inspired by several immunological principles. In particular, some are building models mimicking the mechanisms in the biological immune system (BIS) to better understand its natural processes and simulate its dynamical behavior in the presence of antigens/pathogens. Most of the AIS models, however, emphasize designing artifacts - computational algorithms, techniques using simplified models of various immunological processes and functionalities. Like other biologically-inspired techniques, such as artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, and cellular automata, AISs also try to extract ideas from the BIS in order to develop computational tools for solving science and engineering problems.

1186	Effect of the subwavelength hole symmetry on the enhanced optical transmission through metallic films	Sun, Mei; Tian, Jie; Han, Shouzhen; Li, Zhiyuan; Cheng, Bingying; Zhang, Daozhong; Jin, Aizi; Yang, Haifang	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	We present here the measurements on the extraordinary optical transmission when light passes through different subwavelength hole arrays fabricated on a 120-nm-thick gold film by the focused ion beam system. The comparison of optical transmission shows that the aperiodic concentric circular hole arrays, which possess the sixfold rotational symmetry and central-inversion symmetry, have higher transmittance (about six and two times larger in peak intensity, respectively) than the periodic hexagonal and square lattice of hole array structures. This phenomenon can be attributed to the stronger constructive interference of multiple scattered waves in a higher symmetrical hole array structure. In addition, although the three structures possess the same lattice constant 1ﾠ?m and hole diameter 350ﾠnm, the enhanced transmission peak for the circular hole arrays locates in the visible region, while that of the two periodic structures is in the infrared region. Moreover, when the hole diameter decreases, the transmission peak shifts slightly, while the transmittance drops rapidly.	gold;infrared spectra;lattice constants;metallic thin films;visible spectra7830Er;7840Kc;7866Bz,

Proceedings of the IEEE	20060821	"Our understanding of social insect behavior has significantly influenced artificial intelligence (AI) and multirobot systems' research (e.g., ant algorithms and swarm robotics). In this work, however, we focus on the opposite question: ""How can multirobot systems research contribute to the understanding of social animal behavior?"" As we show, we are able to contribute at several levels. First, using algorithms that originated in the robotics community, we can track animals under observation to provide essential quantitative data for animal behavior research. Second, by developing and applying algorithms originating in speech recognition and computer vision, we can automatically label the behavior of animals under observation. In some cases the automatic labeling is more accurate and consistent than manual behavior identification. Our ultimate goal, however, is to automatically create, from observation, executable models of behavior. An executable model is a control program for an agent that can run in simulation (or on a robot). The representation for these executable models is drawn from research in multirobot systems programming. In this paper we present the algorithms we have developed for tracking, recognizing, and learning models of social animal behavior, details of their implementation, and quantitative experimental results using them to study social insects"	Multirobot systems;social animals;tracking,Acceleration;Animal behavior;Artificial intelligence;Computer vision;Insects;Intelligent robots;Labeling;Multirobot systems;Robotics and automation;Speech recognition,artificial intelligence;biology computing;control engineering computing;multi-robot systemsant movement tracking;artificial intelligence;monkey movement tracking;multirobot systems;robotics algorithms;social animal behavior;social insect behavior

Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20060807	Casual observers of NASA spacecraft, systems, and missions might assume that artificial intelligence has long been integral to what NASA does. However, the reality of high-stakes space missions must balance bold concepts with careful engineering, especially risk management. New capabilities, whether based on AI or other technologies, are adopted only when they offer overwhelming benefits to a mission. Even then, a new capability's risks must be well understood and aggressively retired. And yet, space exploration, whether by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, is not for the faint of heart or vision. Since 1998, when we initiated this department via a special issue, AI has made steady progress in the space realm. In particular, two successful flight-technology experiments-the Remote Agent Experiment (RAX) in 1999, and the Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment (ASE), deployed in 2003 and still functioning on the Earth Observing One (EO-1) platform-validated appropriate uses of AI-based capabilities in future robotic missions.

1200	Puppetry vs. Creationism: Why AI Must Cross the Chasm	Hayes-Roth, R.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20061002	Artificial intelligence began with an enthusiastic embrace of newly available computing machinery and the basic question of what kinds of problems we could solve with it. The first 50 years focused on programming computers to perform tasks that previously only humans could do. Then, people began comparing machines to humans as problem solvers, and the race was on to see where machines could match or even surpass human performance. Success in solving math word problems, winning checkers and chess championships, understanding natural language, and generating plans and schedules reinforced our efforts to build supercapable machines. The author call these puppets, not to derogate the machines but to respect the importance of the programmers and builders who were actually responsible for their accomplishments. From time to time, many of us have recognized the field's rate-limiting factor under various names and viewpoints, such as the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck and the challenges of machine learning, system bootstrapping, artificial life, and self-organizing systems. Mostly, however, these efforts have had limited success. The little bit of learning and adaptation they've demonstrated has paled in comparison to the puppeteers' laborious inputs	agents;autonomy;continuous improvement;learning;the singularity,Artificial intelligence;Clocks;Humans;Intelligent agent;Knowledge engineering;Mobile robots;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Research and development;Vehicle dynamics,artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence;artificial life;knowledge-acquisition;machine learning;puppets;self-organizing systems;system bootstrapping							
1201	HCC implications for the procurement process	O'Leary, D.E.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20060530	AI research has done much over the years to facilitate intelligent guessing. Rule-based systems using information about symptoms help solve medical questions given limited information, even helping the user ferret out the important information. Neural networks combine information about multiple variables to solve several guessing situations. Uncertainty representations help guide users to guessing insights about a wide range of problems including machine fault problems. Knowledge discovery can generate profiles or discover unique relationships among variables. These and other AI areas are steeped in guessing.

1203	IPSS: A Hybrid Approach to Planning and Scheduling Integration	Rodriguez-Moreno, M.D.; Oddi, A.; Borrajo, D.; Cesta, A.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20061030	Recently, the areas of planning and scheduling in artificial intelligence (AI) have witnessed a big push toward their integration in order to solve complex problems. These problems require both reasoning on which actions are to be performed as well as their precedence constraints (planning) and the reasoning with respect to temporal constraints (e.g., duration, precedence, and deadline); those actions should satisfy the resources they use (scheduling). This paper describes IPSS (integrated planning and scheduling system), a domain independent solver that integrates an AI planner that synthesizes courses of actions with constraint-based techniques that reason based upon time and resources. IPSS is able to manage not only simple precedence constraints, but also more complex temporal requirements (as the Allen primitives) and multicapacity resource usage/consumption. The solver is evaluated against a set of problems characterized by the use of multiple agents (or multiple resources) that have to perform tasks with some temporal restrictions in the order of the tasks or some constraints in the availability of the resources. Experiments show how the integrated reasoning approach improves plan parallelism and gains better makespans than some state-of-the-art planners where multiple agents are represented as additional fluents in the problem operators. It also shows that IPSS is suitable for solving real domains (i.e., workflow problems) because it is able to impose temporal windows on the goals or set a maximum makespan, features that most of the planners do not yet incorporate	Planning;constraint satisfaction problem.;scheduling;temporal reasoning,Artificial intelligence;Availability;Performance evaluation;Resource management;Strips;Time factors,inference mechanisms;planning (artificial intelligence);schedulingAI planner;IPSS;constraint-based techniques;integrated planning-scheduling system

1205	Unusual stress behavior in W-incorporated hydrogenated amorphous carbon films	Wang, Ai-Ying; Ahn, Hyo-Shin; Lee, Kwang-Ryeol; Ahn, Jae-Pyoung	Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Unusual stress behavior was observed in W-incorporated hydrogenated amorphous carbon films prepared by a hybrid process composed of ion-beam deposition and magnetron sputtering. As the tungsten concentration increased from 0 to 2.8ﾠat.%, the residual compressive stress decreased by 50%, without significant deterioration in the mechanical properties. This was followed by a rapid increase and a gradual decrease in the residual stress with increasing W concentration. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis and first-principle calculations show that the reduced directionality of the WﾖC bonds in the W-incorporated amorphous carbon matrix relaxes the stress caused by the distorted bonds.	ab initio calculations;amorphous state;carbon;hydrogen;impurity distribution;internal stresses;sputtered coatings;stress relaxation;thin films;transmission electron microscopy;tungsten6143Er;6240+i;6837Lp;6855Jk;6855Ln;6860Bs;8105Uw;8140Jj,							
1206	Continuous wavelength tuning in micromachined Littrow external-cavity lasers	Zhang, X.M.; Liu, A.Q.; Lu, C.; Tang, D.Y.	Quantum Electronics, IEEE Journal of	20050124	This work presents the theory and experiment of the wavelength continuously tunable lasers, whose external cavities are constructed by the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The theoretical study reexamines the wavelength tuning theory and adapts it to the MEMS tunable lasers under special concerns of the system properties such as short cavity length and prealigned component position. It is shown that in the MEMS Littrow lasers a mode-hop-free wavelength tuning requires a moving pivot, or in other words, a fixed pivot has only limited tuning range. In addition, it is also found that the wavelength dependence of the gain medium refractive index significantly affects the wavelength tuning range. Based on the theoretical study, a tuning structure is fabricated by the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, and hybridly integrated with a gain chip and an optical fiber. The laser has dimensions as small as 2.0 mm�1.5 mm�0.6 mm, and can be tuned continuously over 30.3 nm at a resolution of 0.03 nm/V2. As a comparison, another MEMS tunable laser designed according to the conventional theory has only a tuning range of 5.9 nm.	,Etching;Fiber lasers;Laser modes;Laser theory;Laser tuning;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Optical tuning;Refractive index;Tunable circuits and devices,laser cavity resonators;laser tuning;micro-optics;micromachining;micromechanical devices;refractive index;silicon-on-insulator;sputter etching0.6 mm;1.5 mm;2.0 mm;MEMS;deep reactive ion etching;gain chip;microelectromechanical systems;micromachined Littrow external-cavity lasers;mode-hop free wavelength tuning;optical fiber;refractive index;silicon-on-insulator wafer

Schottky emission dominated the leakage current above the ohmic conduction regime. The Schottky barrier height of BLaT/Pt junction was calculated to be 0.84 eV. At low temperatures (?70ﾠﾰC), the breakdown voltage was observed to increase with increasing temperature, which indicates avalanche breakdown. Above this temperature, no apparent dielectric breakdown was observed. The high-temperature high-voltage leakage current showed a linear logﾠJﾖV relation and was interpreted as ionic hopping conduction of thermally activated oxygen vacancies.

The demodulator is based on a free-space Michelson interferometer. Experiments are performed with a 42.7-Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero DPSK signal and a 42.7-Gb/s return-to-zero DPSK signal with 67% duty cycle. Receiver sensitivity (at a bit error rate of 10-9) of better than ?35.5 dBm is achieved for both signals. Negligible temperature-induced penalty is observed over an operational temperature range between 0ﾰC and 70ﾰC.

The resonator is a parallel LC type resonator, in which the capacitor is made up of two metal bridges and the inductor is made up of a shorted stub. The length of the shorted stub is changed by shunt DC contact switches and therefore inductance values of the resonator can be varied. As a result, the resonant frequency of the resonator can be shifted from 8 to 14 GHz with 75% tunable range.

1215	An artificial immune system approach with secondary response for misbehavior detection in mobile ad hoc networks	Sarafijanovic, S.; Le Boudec, J.-Y.	Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on	20050919	In mobile ad hoc networks, nodes act both as terminals and information relays, and they participate in a common routing protocol, such as dynamic source routing (DSR). The network is vulnerable to routing misbehavior, due to faulty or malicious nodes. Misbehavior detection systems aim at removing this vulnerability. In this paper, we investigate the use of an artificial immune system (AIS) to detect node misbehavior in a mobile ad hoc network using DSR. The system is inspired by the natural immune system (IS) of vertebrates. Our goal is to build a system that, like its natural counterpart, automatically learns, and detects new misbehavior. We describe our solution for the classification task of the AIS; it employs negative selection and clonal selection, the algorithms for learning and adaptation used by the natural IS. We define how we map the natural IS concepts such as self, antigen, and antibody to a mobile ad hoc network and give the resulting algorithm for classifying nodes as misbehaving. We implemented the system in the network simulator Glomosim; we present detection results and discuss how the system parameters affect the performance of primary and secondary response. Further steps will extend the design by using an analogy to the innate system, danger signal, and memory cells.

1218	Updating the parameters of a threshold scheme by minimal broadcast	Barwick, S.G.; Jackson, W.-A.; Martin, K.M.	Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on	20050124	Threshold schemes allow secret data to be protected among a set of participants in such a way that only a prespecified threshold of participants can reconstruct the secret from private information (shares) distributed to them on a system setup using secure channels. We consider the general problem of designing unconditionally secure threshold schemes whose defining parameters (the threshold and the number of participants) can later be changed by using only public channel broadcast messages. In this paper, we are interested in the efficiency of such threshold schemes, and seek to minimize storage costs (size of shares) as well as optimize performance in low-bandwidth environments by minimizing the size of necessary broadcast messages. We prove a number of lower bounds on the smallest size of broadcast message necessary to make general changes to the parameters of a threshold scheme in which each participant already holds shares of minimal size. We establish the tightness of these bounds by demonstrating optimal schemes.	,Access control;Access protocols;Australia Council;Broadcasting;Cost function;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Information security;Mathematics;Protection,broadcast channels;cryptography;telecommunication securitycryptology;minimal broadcast;public channel broadcast messages;secret-sharing schemes;secure threshold scheme

1220	Transient stabilization of multimachine power systems with nontrivial transfer conductances	Ortega, R.; Galaz, M.; Astolfi, A.; Yuanzhang Sun; Tielong Shen	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20050117	"We provide a solution to the long-standing problem of transient stabilization of multimachine power systems with nonnegligible transfer conductances. More specifically, we consider the full 3n-dimensional model of the n-generator system with lossy transmission lines and loads and prove the existence of a nonlinear static state feedback law for the generator excitation field that ensures asymptotic stability of the operating point with a well-defined estimate of the domain of attraction provided by a bona fide Lyapunov function. To design the control law we apply the recently introduced interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control methodology that endows the closed-loop system with a port-controlled Hamiltonian structure with desired total energy function. The latter consists of terms akin to kinetic and potential energies, thus has a clear physical interpretation. Our derivations underscore the deleterious effects of resistive elements which, as is well known, hamper the assignment of simple ""gradient"" energy functions and compel us to include nonstandard cross terms. A key step in the construction is the modification of the energy transfer between the electrical and the mechanical parts of the system which is obtained via the introduction of state-modulated interconnections that play the role of multipliers in classical passivity theory."

By reviewing all of the results about this type of transformation in previous references, the electric, compositional, structural, and thermodynamic characteristics of the spontaneous relaxor-normal transformation were proposed. Additionally, the adaptive phase model for martensite transformation proposed by Khachaturyan etal [Phys. Rev. B 43, 10832 (1991)] was introduced into this ferroelectric transformation to explain the unique transformation pathway and associated features such as the tweedlike domain patterns and the dielectric dispersion under the critical transition temperature. Due to the critical compositions near the MPB, the ferroelectric materials just fulfill the condition, in which the adaptive phases can form in the transformation procedure. The formation of the adaptive phases, which are composed of stress-accommodating twinned domains, makes the system bypass the energy barrier encountered in conventional martensite transformations. The twinned adaptive phase corresponds to the tweedlike domain pattern under a transmission electronic microscope. At lower temperature, these precursor phases transform into the conventional ferroelectric state with macrodomains by the movement of domain walls, which causes a weak dispersion in dielectric permittivity.	dielectric losses;electric domain walls;ferroelectric transitions;lead compounds;martensitic transformations;permittivity;relaxor ferroelectrics;transmission electron microscopy;twinning6470Kb;6837Lp;7722Ch;7722Gm;7780Bh;7780Dj;7784Dy;8130Kf,							
1225	Minding your business with AI	Voth, D.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20050808	A new crop of technology grafting AI to data mining techniques is making unstructured data - emails, blogs, business records, manufacturer warranties, and other kinds of text - more useful to companies. This utility sprouts from computers' ability to automatically understand and organize text so that they can slice and dice it. Machine learning, natural language processing, hidden Markov models, and rules-based pattern matching methods parse text for meaning, break it into bits, tag it, and rearrange it. The newly structured text can reveal such information as workflows, instances of impropriety or legal incompliance, cases and causes of problems, and market trends.	,Artificial intelligence;Blogs;Companies;Crops;Data mining;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Manufacturing;Natural language processing;Warranties,artificial intelligence;business data processing;competitive intelligence;data miningartificial intelligence;data mining technique;hidden Markov models;machine learning;natural language processing;rules-based pattern matching method;text analysis

1228	Parallel MATLAB: Doing it Right	Choy, R.; Edelman, A.	Proceedings of the IEEE	20050627	"MATLAB is one of the most widely used mathematical computing environments in technical computing. It is an interactive environment that provides high-performance computational routines and an easy-to-use, C-like scripting language. It started out as an interactive interface to EISPACK and LINPACK and has remained a serial program. In 1995, C. Moler of Mathworks argued that there was no market at the time for a parallel MATLAB. But times have changed and we are seeing increasing interest in developing a parallel MATLAB, from both academic and commercial sectors. In a recent survey, 27 parallel MATLAB projects have been identified. We expand upon that survey and discuss the approaches the projects have taken to parallelize MATLAB. Also, we describe innovative features in some of the parallel MATLAB projects. Then we will conclude with an idea of a ""right"" parallel MATLAB. Finally we will give an example of what we think is a ""right"" parallel MATLAB: MATLAB*P."

At the gas pressure range of 7.6ﾖ60ﾠTorr, only the H- ionic signal is observed. The hydrogen-ion currents rise with the increasing of discharge voltage and ac frequency, but exhibit a maximum over the H2 pressure range studied. The dominant formation mechanism for the H- and H3- anions in the alternative and temporary cathode sheath near the discharge electrode has been discussed.

1230	Teaching Introductory Artificial Intelligence Using a Simple Agent Framework	Pantic, M.; Zwitserloot, R.; Grootjans, R.J.	Education, IEEE Transactions on	20050815	This paper describes a flexible method of teaching introductory artificial intelligence (AI) using a novel, Java-implemented, simple agent framework developed specifically for the purposes of this course. Although numerous agent frameworks have been proposed in the vast body of literature, none of these available frameworks proved to be simple enough to be used by first-year students of computer science. Hence, the authors set out to create a novel framework that would be suitable for the aims of the course, for the level of computing skills of the intended group of students, and for the size of this group of students. The content of the introductory AI course in question is a set of assignments that requires the students to use intelligent agents and other AI techniques to monitor, filter, and retrieve relevant information from the World Wide Web. It represents, therefore, a synthesis of the traditional objectivist approach and a real-world-oriented, constructivist approach to teaching programming to novices. The main aim of implementing such a pedagogy was to engage the students in learning to which they personally relate while attaining intellectual rigor. Classroom experience indicates that students learn more effectively when the traditional objectivist approach is combined with a constructivist approach than when this orthodox approach to teaching programming to novices is used alone.

1231	Design of computer-optimized pseudorandom maximum length signals for linear identification in the presence of nonlinear distortions	Ai Hui Tan; Godfrey, K.R.; Barker, H.A.	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20051121	The design of pseudorandom maximum length (PRML) signals for linear identification in the presence of nonlinear distortions is considered. For this application, it is advantageous for the signal to have harmonic multiples of two and three suppressed, in order to minimize the effect of nonlinearity, thus resulting in a better estimate of the underlying linear dynamics. Such signals may be designed through exhaustive search for the sequence-to-signal conversions. However, for signals generated from Galois fields GF(q) with q large, this method is computationally inefficient. An alternative technique is proposed where a primitive version of the signal, the period of which is considerably shorter than that of the required PRML signal, is first generated as a computer-optimized signal. The primitive signal is then used to define the conversions for the generation of the required PRML signal, which is a member of a new class of hybrid signal.

1232	Structural and anisotropic transport properties of (Hg,Re)Ba2CaCu2Oy vicinal films	Ogawa, A.; Sugano, T.; Wakana, H.; Kamitani, A.; Adachi, S.; Tarutani, Y.; Tanabe, K.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Approximately 160-nm-thick (Hg0.9Re0.1)Ba2CaCu2Oy [(Hg,Re)-1212] epitaxial thin films were fabricated on 2��18.4�-tilt SrTiO3 vicinal substrates with thin buffer layers. The vicinal films had superior crystallinity and superconducting properties comparable to those for conventional films with no tilt. X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the tilt angles of the c axes of the (Hg,Re)-1212 are slightly larger by 0.5��1.5� than the substrate tilt angles, which is attributed to deformation of crystal structure due to lattice mismatch in the c-axis direction. The resistivity and critical current density along the c-axis direction (?c and Jc-c) were estimated to be ?c=500�m?�cm at room temperature and Jc-c=(1.0�1.4)�105�A/cm2 at 10�K from transport measurements for different in-plane directions of the vicinal films. The ?c clearly exhibited semiconductor-like temperature dependence below 180�K. The temperature dependence of Jc-c almost agreed with the theoretical relationship for superconductor-insulator-superconductor junctions. The current�voltage characteristics in the directions across their a�b planes exhibited a multiple branch structure of intrinsic Josephs- on junctions with voltage jumps at intervals of approximately 20�mV at 4�40�K.

1233	A support vectors classifier approach to predicting the risk of progression of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis	Ajemba, P.O.; Ramirez, L.; Durdle, N.G.; Hill, D.L.; Raso, V.J.	Information Technology in Biomedicine, IEEE Transactions on	20050613	"A support vector classifier (SVC) approach was employed in predicting the risk of progression of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a condition that causes visible trunk asymmetries. As the aetiology of AIS is unknown, its risk of progression can only be predicted from measured indicators. Previous studies suggest that individual indicators of AIS do not reliably predict its risk of progression. Complex indicators with better predictive values have been developed but are unsuitable for clinical use as obtaining their values is often onerous, involving much skill and repeated measurements taken over time. Based on the hypothesis that combining common indicators of AIS using an SVC approach would produce better prediction results more quickly, we conducted a study using three datasets comprising a total of 44 moderate AIS patients (30 observed, 14 treated with brace). Of the 44 patients, 13 progressed less than 5ﾰ and 31 progressed more than 5ﾰ. One dataset comprised all the patients. A second dataset comprised all the observed patients and a third comprised all the brace-treated patients. Twenty-one radiographic and clinical indicators were obtained for each patient. The result of testing on the three datasets showed that the system achieved 100% accuracy in training and 65%-80% accuracy in testing. It outperformed a ""statistically equivalent"" logistic regression model and a stepwise linear regression model on the said datasets. It took less than 20 min per patient to measure the indicators, input their values into the system, and produce the needed results, making the system viable for use in a clinical environment."

1236	Novel method of error current compensation for Hall-effect-based high-accuracy current transformer	Xin Ai; Hai Bao; Song, Y. -H	Power Delivery, IEEE Transactions on	20050214	A novel scheme for error current compensation of current transformers (CTs) is presented. The method is to apply Hall current transducers (HCTs) based on magnetic force balance to detect and compensate the error current so as to eliminate the error of CT caused by its exciting current. Theoretical analysis and experimental tests clearly illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme. After compensation, the accuracy of the common CT is increased 500 times from 0.5% (5000 ppm) to 0.001% (10 ppm) at the condition of burden Zb=1 ?, cos ?=1. A self-calibrating method is adopted for a current transformer with the wind ratio of 1:1.

1240	Agent-based control for networked traffic management systems	Fei-Yue Wang	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20050926	Agent or multiagent systems have evolved and diversified rapidly since their inception around the mid 1980s as the key concept and method in distributed artificial intelligence. They have become an established, promising research and application field drawing on and bringing together results and concepts from many disciplines, including AI, computer science, sociology, economics, organization and management science, and philosophy. However, multiagent systems have yet to achieve widespread use for controlling traffic management systems. Most research focuses on developing hierarchical structures, analytical modeling, and optimized algorithms that are effective for real-time traffic applications, as you can see from well-known traffic control systems such as CRONOS, OPAC, SCOOT, SCAT, PRODYN, and RHODES. Although those functional-decomposition-based systems are useful and successful for many traffic management problems, costs and difficulties associated with their development, operation, maintenance, expansion, and upgrading are often prohibitive and sometimes unnecessary, especially in the rapidly arriving age of connectivity. We need to rethink control systems and reinvestigate the use of simple task-oriented agents for traffic control and management of transportation systems.

We will prove the mathematical equivalence between the conditional mean of a GMM, and the defuzzified output of a generalized fuzzy model (GFM). The relationship between a GMM and a GFM, and the conditions for GMM to GFM translation will be made explicit in the form of theorems. The work will then extend to special cases of the GFM, specifically the Mamdani-Larsen and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. The possibility of reverse translation, that is, from a GFM to a GMM will also be discussed. Finally, we will consider the generality of a GMM, specifically how it can approximate other distribution functions.

1244	EM-ML algorithm for track initialization using possibly noninformative data	Jie Cai; Sinha, A.; Kirubarajan, T.	Aerospace and Electronic Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20051121	Initializing and maintaining a track for a low observable (LO) (low SNR, low target detection probability and high false alarm rate) target can be very challenging because of the low information content of measurements. In addition, in some scenarios, target-originated measurements might not be present in many consecutive scans because of mispointing, target maneuvers, or erroneous preprocessing. That is, one might have a set of noninformative scans that could result in poor track initialization and maintenance. In this paper an algorithm based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm combined with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is presented for tracking slowly maneuvering targets in heavy clutter and possibly noninformative scans. The adaptive sliding-window EM-ML approach, which operates in batch mode, tries to reject or weight down noninformative scans using the Q-function in the M-step of the EM algorithm. It is shown that target features in the form of, for example, amplitude information (AI), can also be used to improve the estimates. In addition, performance bounds based on the supplemented EM (SEM) technique are also presented. The effectiveness of new algorithm is first demonstrated on a 78-frame long wave infrared (LWIR) data sequence consisting of an Fl Mirage fighter jet in heavy clutter. Previously, this scenario has been used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of other track initialization algorithms. The new EM-ML estimator confirms the track by frame 20 while the ML-PDA (maximum likelihood estimator combined with probabilistic data association) algorithm, the IMM-MHT (interacting multiple model estimator combined with multiple hypothesis tracking) and the EVIM-PDA estimator previously required 28, 38, and 39 frames, respectively. The benefits of the new algorithm in terms of accuracy, early detection, and computational load are illustrated using simulated scenarios as well.	,Amplitude estimation;Artificial intelligence;Clutter;Computational modeling;Computer aided instruction;Maximum likelihood detection;Maximum likelihood estimation;Object detection;Radar tracking;Target tracking,clutter;image sequences;maximum likelihood estimation;military aircraft;target trackingEM-ML algorithm;EVIM-PDA estimator;Fl Mirage fighter jet;amplitude information;erroneous preprocessing;expectation-maximization algorithm;interacting multiple model estimator;long wave infrared data sequence;maneuvering targets;maximum likelihood estimation;multiple hypothesis tracking;noninformative scans;probabilistic data association;supplemented EM technique;target detection probability;target maneuvers;target-originated measurements;track initialization algorithms

It is shown that (global) output feedback stabilization for a class of systems in feedforward form can be achieved with a dynamic feedback law, yielding bounded control, and relying on the introduction of a reduced-order observer. The above result, together with standard tools borrowed from the output regulator theory, is instrumental to construct dynamic control laws achieving (approximate) disturbance rejection and output tracking in the presence of (small) disturbance/reference signals generated by a known exosystem.

1247	Effects of PAPR reduction on HPA predistortion	Li Bo; Yang Zhi-xing; Pan Chang-yong; Zhang Tao-tao; Ge Jian-hua	Consumer Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20051219	There have been many papers concerning about the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction and high power amplifier (HPA) linearization techniques for wireless OFDM communication systems. Few papers, however, make deep analysis on the relation between these two techniques. Based on Saleh's memoryless traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) model, computer simulations and analysis in this paper demonstrates that, especially when the HPA is working near or in the saturation region, a predistorter ceases to be in effect. In such cases, PAPR reduction techniques may be resorted to help to improve the adjacent channel interference (ACI), BER performances and HPA efficiency.	,Bit error rate;Computer simulation;High power amplifiers;Interchannel interference;Linearization techniques;OFDM;Peak to average power ratio;Power system modeling;Predistortion;Wireless communication,OFDM modulation;adjacent channel interference;error statistics;linearisation techniques;power amplifiers;travelling wave amplifiers;travelling wave tubesHPA predistortion;PAPR reduction;adjacent channel interference;high power amplifier linearization techniques;memoryless traveling wave tube amplifier;peak to average power ratio;wireless OFDM communication systems

1249	Digital processing of dual-frequency servo burst in hard disk drives	Al Mamun, A.; Guo, G.; Tan, K.C.; Yimei Liu	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20050718	The trend of increasing areal density, i.e., the number of bits recorded in unit area of the media, continues in the hard disk drive (HDD) industry. This growth is sustained by increasing both the track density and bit density. The track density that can be achieved in a drive depends on many factors such as the dimensions of read/write head and the performance of the head positioning servomechanism. The higher the servo bandwidth, the better the precision achieved in controlling the position of the head. Most of the drives use an embedded servo scheme, which puts a physical constraint on the frequency at which the position error is sampled, and hence, on the achievable bandwidth. The need for a better position error sensing (PES) scheme is the motivation behind exploring alternative methods of servo encoding. This paper addresses different aspects of decoding position error from the dual-frequency servo bursts. It is shown, using both simulation and experimental results, that the proposed scheme offers a feasible solution for generating the PES signal in high-performance HDD.

1250	Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one	Acosta, J.A.; Ortega, R.; Astolfi, A.; Mahindrakar, A.D.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20051212	Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control is a new controller design methodology developed for (asymptotic) stabilization of nonlinear systems that does not rely on, sometimes unnatural and technique-driven, linearization or decoupling procedures but instead endows the closed-loop system with a Hamiltonian structure with a desired energy function-that qualifies as Lyapunov function for the desired equilibrium. The assignable energy functions are characterized by a set of partial differential equations that must be solved to determine the control law. We prove in this paper that for a class of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one the partial differential equations can be explicitly solved. Furthermore, we introduce a suitable parametrization of assignable energy functions that provides the designer with a handle to address transient performance and robustness issues. Finally, we develop a speed estimator that allows the implementation of position-feedback controllers. The new result is applied to obtain an (almost) globally stabilizing scheme for the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with strong input coupling, and a controller for the pendulum in a cart that can swing-up the pendulum from any position in the upper half plane and stop the cart at any desired location. In both cases we obtain very simple and intuitive position-feedback solutions.

1251	AI		Turing (A Novel about Computation)	20120924	"Our hero is Turing, an interactive tutoring program and namesake (or virtual emanation?) of Alan Turing, World War II code breaker and father of computer science. In this unusual novel, Turing's idiosyncratic version of intellectual history from a computational point of view unfolds in tandem with the story of a love affair involving Ethel, a successful computer executive, Alexandros, a melancholy archaeologist, and Ian, a charismatic hacker. After Ethel (who shares her first name with Alan Turing's mother) abandons Alexandros following a sundrenched idyll on Corfu, Turing appears on Alexandros's computer screen to unfurl a tutorial on the history of ideas. He begins with the philosopher-mathematicians of ancient Greece -- ""discourse, dialogue, argument, proof... can only thrive in an egalitarian society"" -- and the Arab scholar in ninth-century Baghdad who invented algorithms; he moves on to many other topics, including cryptography and artificial intelligence, even economics and developmental biology. (These lessons are later critiqued amusingly and developed further in postings by a fictional newsgroup in the book's afterword.) As Turing's lectures progress, the lives of Alexandros, Ethel, and Ian converge in dramatic fashion, and the story takes us from Corfu to Hong Kong, from Athens to San Francisco -- and of course to the Internet, the disruptive technological and social force that emerges as the main locale and protagonist of the novel.Alternately pedagogical and romantic, Turing (A Novel about Computation) should appeal both to students and professionals who want a clear and entertaining account of the development of computation and to the general reader who enjoys novels of ideas."

1253	Improvement in reproducibility of multilayer and junction process for HTS SFQ circuits	Wakana, H.; Adachi, S.; Kamitani, Ai; Nakayama, K.; Ishimaru, Y.; Oshikubo, Y.; Tarutani, Y.; Tanabe, K.	Applied Superconductivity, IEEE Transactions on	20050613	We have developed an HTS multilayer structure including a superconducting ground plane and interface-engineered ramp-edge Josephson junctions for single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits, and tried to improve reproducibility in the multilayer and junction process. We found that one of the crucial factors to improve the reproducibility is use of a ground plane with small average surface roughness (Ra) of typically less than 2 nm and a high Tc above 87 K. By employing La0.2-Y0.9Ba1.9Cu3Ox (La-YBCO) thin films deposited by dc off-axis magnetron sputtering, such high quality was maintained for 3-month successive use of a ceramic target. Use of such a high-quality ground plane reproducibly led to SrSnO3/La-YBCO/SrSnO3/La-YBCO //MgO multilayer structures with Ra?2 nm and 100-junction arrays with 1-?Ic spread of 6-17% at 4.2 K depending on the average Ic level. The run-to-run reproducibility of average junction Ic and sheet inductance of both the base- and counter-electrodes for three samples was ﾱ12%, ﾱ3.0%, and ﾱ3.4%, respectively, which are substantially smaller than those previously reported.

Ultrafine BT (?40ﾖ50ﾠnm) nanocrystals with pure perovskite tetragonal phase were synthesized by hydrothermal method. The structure of BT nanocrystals and composite films were studied by means of x-ray diffraction and transmission scanning microscopy. The composite films were poled with a high electric field at a suitable temperature to yield a noncentrosymmetric arrangement and produce better electro-optic properties. The poling condition under external electric field was optimized through the dielectric properties of BT and PC polymer and the effective-field intensity theory. The electro-optic (EO) coefficients and transmittance of composite films with various BT concentrations were also evaluated. The average effective linear EO coefficient and figure of merit of 20-wt % BT-doped composite films were about 63.1 and 103.1ﾠpm/V, respectively. BT/PC composite films show excellent electro-optic properties for application in integrated optoelectronics and optics.

The incorporation of Co ions was identified by energy dispersive spectroscopy. The Ti:Co atomic ratio in the obtained nanotubes was found significantly less than the value in the powder precursor. This indicates that the precursor powders were deformed in NaOH solution before the formation of nanotubes.

This project begun in 2003 as a contest, dubbed Project Halo, where three sets of high-powered researchers competed to create software that could do well on a high school advanced-placement exam in chemistry, and they all succeeded. In the second phase, the three teams will build knowledge-acquisition tools that will let Ph.D. students in physics, chemistry, and biology pass on knowledge of their subject area. The software tools they construct will have to be able to turn the classroom learning into the knowledge rules that an AI machine has to have in order to pass an advanced-placement exam.

1259	Is normalization necessary for stable model reference adaptive control?	Barabanov, N.; Ortega, R.; Astolfi, A.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20050912	One of the longest standing open questions in adaptive control concerns the correctness of the stability claim of the un-normalized model reference scheme proposed by Monopoli in 1974. Although provably correct solutions to the problem now abound, in particular, it is well known that adding a normalization to Monopoli's original scheme ensures global convergence, it is interesting to know whether this technique-driven modification is really necessary or only required to complete the stability proof in the absence of more elaborate arguments. In this note, we construct a counterexample that provides a definite-unfortunately, negative-answer to the claim. Instrumental for the establishment of this result is a technical lemma that shows that, under some conditions on the regressor that may appear in Monopoli's scheme, the parameter error freezes as the adaptation gain goes to infinity. On the lighter side, we also prove that Monopoli's scheme is semiglobally stable, underscoring the relevance of this important contribution.

1260	The Estimation of Distributions and the Minimum Relative Entropy Principle	M&#252;hlenbein, H; H&#246;ns, R	Evolutionary Computation	20140519	Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) have been proposed as an extension of genetic algorithms. In this paper we explain the relationship of EDA to algorithms developed in statistics, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics. The major design issues are discussed within a general interdisciplinary framework. It is shown that maximum entropy approximations play a crucial role. All proposed algorithms try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence KLD between the unknown distribution p(x) and a class q(x) of approximations. However, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not symmetric. Approximations which suppose that the function to be optimized is additively decomposed (ADF) minimize KLD(q||p), the methods which learn the approximate model from data minimize KLD(p||q). This minimization is identical to maximizing the log-likelihood. In the paper three classes of algorithms are discussed. FDAuses the ADF to compute an approximate factorization of the unknown distribution. The factors are marginal distributions, whose values are computed from samples. The second class is represented by the Bethe-Kikuchi approach which has recently been rediscovered in statistical physics. Here the values of the marginals are computed from a difficult constrained minimization problem. The third class learns the factorization from the data. We analyze our learning algorithm LFDA in detail. It is shown that learning is faced with two problems: first, to detect the important dependencies between the variables, and second, to create an acyclic Bayesian network of bounded clique size.

1261	An IPv4-IPv6 translation mechanism for SIP overlay network in UMTS all-IP environment	Whai-En Chen; Yi-Bing Lin; Ai-Chun Pang	Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on	20051031	Both IPv6 and session initiation protocol (SIP) are default protocols for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) all-Internet protocol (IP) network. In the existing mobile telecommunications environments, an IPv6-based UMTS all-IP network needs to interwork with other Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4)-based SIP networks. Therefore, mobile SIP applications are typically offered through an overlay structure over the IPv4-Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) interworking environments. Based on 3GPP 23.228, we propose an IPv4-IPv6 translation mechanism (i.e., SIPv6 translator) that integrates different IP infrastructures (i.e., IPv4 and IPv6) to provide an overlay network for transparent SIP application deployment. In this paper, we present the architecture and the call flows of the SIPv6 translator. An analytic model is proposed to investigate the fault tolerance issue of our approach. Our study provides guidelines to select appropriate number of processors for fault tolerance.

""Technology,"" she writes, ""catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think."" First published in 1984, The Second Self is still essential reading as a primer in the psychology of computation. This twentieth anniversary edition allows us to reconsider two decades of computer culture--to (re)experience what was and is most novel in our new media culture and to view our own contemporary relationship with technology with fresh eyes. Turkle frames this classic work with a new introduction, a new epilogue, and extensive notes added to the original text.Turkle talks to children, college students, engineers, AI scientists, hackers, and personal computer owners--people confronting machines that seem to think and at the same time suggest a new way for us to think--about human thought, emotion, memory, and understanding. Her interviews reveal that we experience computers as being on the border between inanimate and animate, as both an extension of the self and part of the external world. Their special place betwixt and between traditional categories is part of what makes them compelling and evocative. (In the introduction to this edition, Turkle quotes a PDA user as saying, ""When my Palm crashed, it was like a death. I thought I had lost my mind."")

1263	Linear MEMS variable optical attenuator using reflective elliptical mirror	Cai, H.; Zhang, X.M.; Lu, C.; Liu, A.Q.; Khoo, E.H.	Photonics Technology Letters, IEEE	20050124	We propose an improved design of variable optical attenuator (VOA) using a micromachined elliptical mirror, which offers the advantages of both the shutter-type VOAs and the flat-mirror reflection-type VOAs while overcoming their problems. This design positions the input and output fibers at the two focal centers of the reflective elliptical mirror. Since the ellipse can focus the light from one center to the other, the VOA enjoys low insertion loss while using the normally cleaved single-mode fibers. As the mirror is displaced, the input beam is rapidly defocused, producing a large attenuation range without requiring a large mirror displacement. This VOA also has low polarization dependence loss (PDL), low wavelength dependence loss (WDL), and low back reflection. It is fabricated by the deep reactive ion etching process and achieves 44-dB attenuation at 10.7-V driving voltage. The PDL is 0.8 dB at the 40-dB attenuation level and the WDL is 1.2 dB at the 20-dB level for 100-nm wavelength change. More importantly, the measurement shows that attenuation has a nearly linear relationship with the mirror displacement over a 30-dB attenuation range.

On the other hand, this specimen underwent an evident spontaneous normal-relaxation transition, whereas the as-annealed one did not. The corresponding reason has been analyzed on the basis of the facts, which provide some evidence that the interior stresses due to oxygen deficiency induce the spontaneous normal-relaxor transition in the specimen sintered in reductive ambient.	annealing;electrical conductivity;internal stresses;lanthanum compounds;lead compounds;relaxor ferroelectrics;sintering;vacancies (crystal)6172Cc;6172Ji;6220-x;7780-e;7784Dy,

The EBG filter is fabricated on high resistivity silicon substrate employing a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) surface micromachining process. The measurement results for the loaded EBG reveals a 20 dB stop-band with a bandwidth of 13.2 GHz. The lower and the higher pass-band insertion losses are less than 2 dB and 4.5 dB, respectively.

It was found that the overlap percentage had little effect on the etching characteristics of niobium. It also showed that the I2 radicals are more reactant with niobium than XeF2 radicals, and to obtain maximum improvement from the gas-assisted etching process one needs to select a smaller ion beam current with a shorter beam dwell time.	ion beam effects;niobium;sputter etching;type II superconductors6180Jh;7470Ad;8165Cf,

1270	Design and preliminary tests of a family of adaptive waveforms to measure blood vessel diameter and wall thickness	Ai, Y.; Jaffe, J.S.	Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, IEEE Transactions on	20050321	In this article, we consider the adaptive design of waveforms to be used in vascular ultrasound. The advantage of these waveforms, when used with the proposed processing scheme, is that their application results in increased reflected energy, especially when compared with more conventional methods such as a short-gated sinusoid. This increase in reflected energy has potential to permit inferences to be made about wall thickness and vessel diameter from deeper vessels than possible with more traditional techniques. Here, the use of waveforms of the type A(t)e(j(kt/sup 2/)), 0/spl les/t/spl les/b, where A(t) is a specially designed envelope and k a sweep frequency, are proposed. Theorems are proved that describe how to choose an A(t) which results in either a maximum of reflected energy signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or range resolution. The design of the waveform is adaptive in that both A(t) and k are derived in consideration of a specific blood vessel whose transfer function has been obtained experimentally. Numerical simulations illustrate the advantages of using these waveforms as well as the effects of the parameters. A simple experimental implementation of the methodology is presented on a brachial artery. The measurement of the impulse response of the artery is presented in this context. Results indicate that a processing gain in SNR over the instantaneous values obtained from the raw echo waveforms of 11 dB to 14 dB can be obtained via this methodology.	,Arteries;Blood vessels;Energy resolution;Frequency;Potential energy;Signal to noise ratio;Testing;Thickness measurement;Ultrasonic imaging;Ultrasonic variables measurement,biomedical measurement;biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;diameter measurement;medical signal processing;numerical analysis;thickness measurement;ultrasonic measurementSNR;adaptive design;adaptive waveforms;blood vessel diameter measurement;blood vessel wall thickness measurement;brachial artery;echo waveforms;numerical simulations;signal-noise ratio;transfer function;vascular ultrasoundBrachial Artery;Computer Simulation;Humans;Mathematics;Models, Structural;Pulsatile Flow;Software;Ultrasonography							
1271	A radix-4 scalable design	Tawalbeh, L.A.; Tenca, A.F.; Koc, C.K.	Potentials, IEEE	20050711	Modular arithmetic operations are very important in cryptography. Modular multiplication is the most common arithmetic operation used in many cryptographic algorithms such as the Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the Diffie-Helman key exchange. The Montgomery Modular Multiplication algorithm (MM) has permitted cryptographic algorithms to speed up considerably. Multiplication is implemented by a series of multiprecision partial-product addition. The proposed multiple-word Radix-4 Montgomery Multiplication algorithm (R4MM) is extension of the Multiple-Word High-Radix (R2k) Montgomery Multiplication algorithm (MWR2kMM). There are two types of recoding applied in the R4MM. The architecture of the modular multiplier that implements the R4MM consists of three main blocks: the datapath (or kernel), the IO & memory and the control block. The computation in the R4MM algorithm takes place in the kernel. We show that a more elaborate design using two types of digit recoding makes the radix-4 design the best solution for the implementation of this scalable multiplier.	,Clocks;Computer architecture;Encoding;Kernel;Pipelines;Registers,adders;cryptography;digital arithmetic;multiplying circuitsDiffie-Helman key exchange;digit recoding;elliptic curve cryptography algorithm;modular arithmetic operations;modular multiplier;multiple-word Radix-4 Montgomery multiplication algorithm;multiprecision partial-product addition							
1272	Holonic job shop scheduling using a multiagent system	Walker, S.S.; Brennan, R.W.; Norrie, D.H.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20050404	Manufacturing job shop scheduling is a notoriously difficult problem that lends itself to various approaches - from optimal algorithms to suboptimal heuristics. We combined popular heuristic job shop-scheduling approaches with emerging AI techniques to create a dynamic and responsive scheduler. We fashioned our job shop scheduler's architecture around recent holonic manufacturing systems architectures and implemented our system using multiagent systems. Our scheduling approach is based on evolutionary algorithms but differs from common approaches by evolving the scheduler rather than the schedule.

1273	A geometric characterization of feedforward forms	Astolfi, A.; Kaliora, G.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20050711	This note addresses the problem of (local) coordinates and feedback equivalence of single-input affine nonlinear systems to feedforward forms. In particular, using the notions of invariant and controlled invariant distributions we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a general affine in control nonlinear system to be (locally) coordinates or feedback equivalent to a system in (strict) feedforward form. For illustration, the general theory is applied to a simple four-dimensional system describing the dynamics of a food-chain.

1274	Fabrication technique for microelectromechanical systems vertical comb-drive actuators on a monolithic silicon substrate	Zhang, Q.X.; Liu, A.Q.; Li, J.; Yu, A.B.	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures	20090618	This article presents a technique to fabricate a microelectromechanical systems vertical comb-drive actuator on a monolithic silicon substrate. This technique employs only two photomasks. The first photomask defines all the critical patterns, including a set of movable upper hollow comb fingers, a set of fixed lower comb fingers, and a suspension spring to avoid the alignment problem and maintain a small finger gap. The second photomask selectively covers the upper fingers to obtain the released upper hollow fingers. The vertical comb-drive actuator is fabricated by deep reactive ion etching process on a monolithic silicon wafer using these uniquely designed photomasks to avoid the residual stress and stiction problems. Different lateral gaps between the adjacent lower solid and upper hollow fingers are obtained with various finger widths. The height of the comb fingers is 10.0 ?m. The vertical offset between the two sets of comb fingers can be adjusted by controlling the process conditions. Both symmetric and asymmetric staggered comb-drives are achieved through process modifications. The mechanism of notching effect is discussed and addressed by multiple spacer oxide deposition. Silicon residue effect, which occurs during the lowering down etching process, is investigated from the fabrication aspect and resolved by combining isotropic and anisotropic etching processes. This kind of vertical comb-drive actuator can be widely applied in optical switches, scanning micromirrors, and sensors.	electrostatic actuators;sputter etching0710Cm;8165Cf;8585+j,

1277	TEXTAL: AI-based structural determination for X-ray protein crystallography	Romo, T.; Gopal, K.; McKee, E.; Kanbi, L.; Pai, R.; Smith, J.; Sacchettini, J.; loerger, T.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20051212	TEXTAL is a successfully deployed system for automated model-building in protein X-ray crystallography. It represents a novel solution to an important, complex real-world, problem using various AI and pattern recognition algorithms. TEXTAL takes a model-building approach based on real-space density pattern recognition, similar to how a human crystallographer would work. TEXTAL first tries to predict the coordinates of the alpha-carbon (C?) atoms in the protein's connected backbone using a neural network. It then analyzes the density patterns around each C? atom and searches a database of previously solved structures for regions with similar patterns. TEXTAL determines the best match, retrieves the coordinates for that region, and fits them to the unknown density. TEXTAL concatenates these local models into a global model and subjects them to various subsequent refinements to produce a complete protein model automatically.

1278	On optimizing syntactic pattern recognition using tries and AI-based heuristic-search strategies	Badr, G.; Oommen, B.J.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20060605	This paper deals with the problem of estimating, using enhanced artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques, a transmitted string X* by processing the corresponding string Y, which is a noisy version of X*. It is assumed that Y contains substitution, insertion, and deletion (SID) errors. The best estimate X+ of X* is defined as that element of a dictionary H that minimizes the generalized Levenshtein distance (GLD) D(X,Y) between X and Y, for all X?H. In this paper, it is shown how to evaluate D(X,Y) for every X?H simultaneously, when the edit distances are general and the maximum number of errors is not given a priori, and when H is stored as a trie. A new scheme called clustered beam search (CBS) is first introduced, which is a heuristic-based search approach that enhances the well-known beam-search (BS) techniques used in AI. The new scheme is then applied to the approximate string-matching problem when the dictionary is stored as a trie. The new technique is compared with the benchmark depth-first search (DFS) trie-based technique (with respect to time and accuracy) using large and small dictionaries. The results demonstrate a marked improvement of up to 75% with respect to the total number of operations needed on three benchmark dictionaries, while yielding an accuracy comparable to the optimal. Experiments are also done to show the benefits of the CBS over the BS when the search is done on the trie. The results also demonstrate a marked improvement (more than 91%) for large dictionaries.

1280	Combining FDI and AI approaches within causal-model-based diagnosis	Gentil, S.; Montmain, J.; Combastel, C.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20040920	This paper presents a model-based diagnostic method designed in the context of process supervision. It has been inspired by both artificial intelligence and control theory. AI contributes tools for qualitative modeling, including causal modeling, whose aim is to split a complex process into elementary submodels. Control theory, within the framework of fault detection and isolation (FDI), provides numerical models for generating and testing residuals, and for taking into account inaccuracies in the model, unknown disturbances and noise. Consistency-based reasoning provides a logical foundation for diagnostic reasoning and clarifies fundamental assumptions, such as single fault and exoneration. The diagnostic method presented in the paper benefits from the advantages of all these approaches. Causal modeling enables the method to focus on sufficient relations for fault isolation, which avoids combinatorial explosion. Moreover, it allows the model to be modified easily without changing any aspect of the diagnostic algorithm. The numerical submodels that are used to detect inconsistency benefit from the precise quantitative analysis of the FDI approach. The FDI models are studied in order to link this method with DX component-oriented reasoning. The recursive on-line use of this algorithm is explained and the concept of local exoneration is introduced.	,Artificial intelligence;Context modeling;Control theory;Design methodology;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Humans;Numerical models;Power system modeling;Testing,cognitive systems;control theory;fault diagnosis;graph theory;large-scale systemsartificial intelligence;causal graph;causal-model-based diagnosis;component-oriented reasoning;consistency-based reasoning;control theory;diagnostic algorithm;fault detection;fault isolation;numerical model;process supervisionAlgorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Equipment Failure Analysis;Interdisciplinary Communication;Models, Theoretical;Research;Systems Integration							
1281	Improving efficiency in mobile robot task planning through world abstraction	Galindo, C.; Fernandez-Madrigal, J.-A.; Gonzalez, J.	Robotics, IEEE Transactions on	20040809	"Task planning in mobile robotics should be performed efficiently, due to real-time requirements of robot-environment interaction. Its computational efficiency depends both on the number of operators (actions the robot can perform without planning) and the size of the world states (descriptions of the world before and after the application of operators). Thus, in real robotic applications, where both components can be large, planning may turn inefficient, and even unsolvable. In the artificial intelligence (AI) literature on planning, little attention has been put into efficient management of large-scale world descriptions. In real large-scale situations, conventional AI planners (in spite of the most modern improvements) may consume intractable amounts of storage and computing time, due to the huge amount of information. This paper proposes a new approach to task planning called ""hierarchical task planning through world abstraction"" that, by hierarchically arranging the world representation, becomes a good complement of Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver-style planners, significantly improving their computational efficiency. Broadly speaking, our approach works by first solving the task-planning problem in a highly abstracted model of the environment of the robot, and then refines the solution under more detailed models, where irrelevant world elements can be ignored, due to the results previously obtained at abstracted levels. Among the different implementations that can be made with our general strategy, we describe two that use a graph-based hierarchical world representation named the ""annotated and hierarchical"" graph. We show experiments, as well as results of a mobile robot operating in a large-scale environment, that demonstrate an important improvement in the efficiency of our algorithms with respect to conventional (both hierarchical and nonhierarchical) planning and their nice integration with existing planners."

1282	Electrostatic discharge and electrical breakdown study of the head-disk interface in a hard disk drive	Wallash, Albert J.	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20040518	A systematic and comprehensive procedure for understanding electrostatic discharge and electrical breakdown at the head-disk interface in a hard disk drive is described. First, the resistance, breakdown and field emission behavior for the individual and combined carbon overcoat films on the disk and slider was determined through current versus voltage testing. Second, different electrostatic mechanisms that can produce a voltage difference between the disk and slider or read transducer were studied. Results are explained in terms of the relative time constants for the voltage on the head and disk. It is concluded that a potential difference between the disk and recording head as little as 2 V can result in electrical breakdown damage at the head-disk interface.

1285	Stochastic Reasoning, Free Energy, and Information Geometry	Ikeda, S; Tanaka, T; Amari, S	Neural Computation	20140519	Belief propagation (BP) is a universal method of stochastic reasoning. It gives exact inference for stochastic models with tree interactions and works surprisingly well even if the models have loopy interactions. Its performance has been analyzed separately in many fields, such as AI, statistical physics, information theory, and information geometry. This article gives a unified framework for understanding BP and related methods and summarizes the results obtained in many fields. In particular, BP and its variants, including tree reparameterization and concave-convex procedure, are reformulated with information-geometrical terms, and their relations to the free energy function are elucidated from an information-geometrical viewpoint. We then propose a family of new algorithms. The stabilities of the algorithms are analyzed, and methods to accelerate them are investigated.

1287	Deploying intelligent systems on a global scale	Willmott, S.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20050502	Intelligent systems are rarely deployed in isolation. Furthermore, with the advent of the global Internet, corporate intranets, and the Web, the potential for interactions between intelligent systems has never been greater. However, new technologies such as Web services, the semantic Web, grid computing, and peer-to-peer networks have made it easier than ever to create intelligent applications that span not only multiple machines but also multiple sites and organizations. So, one great challenge in intelligent systems research is to harness these technologies to verify and apply longstanding theories from distributed AI, agent systems, and other areas of networked intelligent systems research. Although we can generate knowledge from models, simulations, and small-scale trials, gaining a thorough understanding of intelligent systems requires increasingly large-scale deployments in challenging environments. Unfortunately, such experimentation is time consuming and costly-often requiring significant infrastructure development, maintenance, and low-level implementation before we can tackle more challenging and innovative elements. As the environments in which we employ intelligent systems continue to grow, so do the costs of deploying, testing, and verifying such systems.

1288	Moving AI out of its infancy: changing our preconceptions	Grand, S.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20050502	Explicit symbolic logic has faded from prominence, but the close coupling of AI and the digital computer, and of thought and the stepwise algorithm, seem about as strong and unquestioned as ever. Of course there's connectionism, but this too is mired in false assumptions that date back a long way. And it seems to have dragged neuroscience down with it to the extent that we now seem unable to think about real brains without resorting to models that owe too much of their inspiration to the three-layer perceptron. Traditional AI has excelled at solving certain kinds of problems. It can make systems that learn but not in any generally applicable way. AI is about making machines do what humans use intelligence to do, and often this doesn't actually require the machines to show any intelligence at all. But for many tasks, especially in robotics, the ability to see, learn, and perform complex motor actions is a prerequisite that the traditional approach has utterly failed to fulfill.

1289	A simplifier for propositional formulas with many binary clauses	Brafman, R.I.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20040130	Deciding whether a propositional formula in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable (SAT) is an NP-complete problem. The problem becomes linear when the formula contains binary clauses only. Interestingly, the reduction to SAT of a number of well-known and important problems-such as classical AI planning and automatic test pattern generation for circuits-yields formulas containing many binary clauses. In this paper we introduce and experiment with 2-SIMPLIFY, a formula simplifier targeted at such problems. 2-SIMPLIFY constructs the transitive closure of the implication graph corresponding to the binary clauses in the formula and uses this graph to deduce new unit literals. The deduced literals are used to simplify the formula and update the graph, and so on, until stabilization. Finally, we use the graph to construct an equivalent, simpler set of binary clauses. Experimental evaluation of this simplifier on a number of bench-mark formulas produced by encoding AI planning problems prove 2-SIMPLIFY to be a useful tool in many circumstances.	,Artificial intelligence;Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit testing;Encoding;NP-complete problem;Process planning;Robots;Stochastic systems;Technology planning;Test pattern generators,automatic test pattern generation;computability;computational complexity;graph theory;planning (artificial intelligence)2-SIMPLIFY formula simplifier;AI planning;NP-complete problem;automatic test pattern generation;binary clauses;conjunctive normal form;deduced literals;implication graph;propositional formulas;satisfiability problem;transitive closure

A new method to estimate the channel state information (CSI) for the Viterbi decoder is proposed, which overcomes the problem of reliability metric of transmitted signals in wireless as well as mobile channels. The CSI for each subcarrier is calculated as a properly defined squared Euclidean distance. On the basis of which, a soft decision decoding scheme to improve reception performance under multipath fading interference and co-channel interference (CCI) from existing analog broadcasting signals is also proposed. The simulation results show that the scheme can provide a compatible improvement to the terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T) system. The proposed scheme is also suitable for other wireless COFDM transmission systems.	,Decoding;Digital video broadcasting;Fading;Modulation coding;OFDM modulation;Power system reliability;Radiofrequency interference;State estimation;TV broadcasting;Viterbi algorithm,OFDM modulation;Viterbi decoding;channel estimation;cochannel interference;digital video broadcasting;fading channels;multipath channels;telecommunication network reliabilityDVB-T;Viterbi decoder;analog broadcasting signals;channel state information estimation;cochannel interference;coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;mobile channels;multipath fading interference;reception performance;reliability metric;soft decision decoding scheme;squared Euclidean distance;terrestrial digital video broadcasting;wireless COFDM;wireless channels

1292	Hole traps in silicon dioxides. Part I. Properties	Zhang, J.F.; Zhao, C.Z.; Chen, A.H.; Groeseneken, G.; Degraeve, R.	Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on	20040726	As the downscaling of gate oxides continues, trap density in the oxide bulk will reduce, but positive charges formed near to the SiO2/Si interface become relatively important. For gate oxides used in industry, hole trapping is the most important process for positive charge formation. Apart from as-grown hole traps, we recently reported that new hole traps were generated by electrical stresses. Information on these hole traps, however, is still limited. In part I of this work, properties of both generated and as-grown hole traps are investigated. For the first time, it will be clearly shown that generated hole traps consist of two components; cyclic positive charges (CPC) and antineutralization positive charges (ANPC). The charging and discharging rates of CPC are similar, while the neutralization of ANPC is much more difficult than its charging. Differences between them are also observed in generation kinetics and dependence on measurement temperature. Efforts will be made to explain their differences in terms of energy levels and to link them with positive charges reported in earlier works. We will also show that as-grown traps, regardless their distance from the interface, are not responsible for either ANPC or CPC. This is to say that generated hole traps are not the same as as-grown traps and their differences will be highlighted. In part II, hole trap generation mechanisms will be investigated.

1294	Decimal frequency offset estimation in COFDM wireless communications	Bo Ai; Ge Jian-hua; Yong Wang; Shi-yong Yang; Pei Liu	Broadcasting, IEEE Transactions on	20040614	Timing jitter, frequency offset, carrier phase jitter and sampling clock frequency offset are the main synchronization errors encountered by OFDM systems. As many literature studies have proved, OFDM systems are very sensitive to frequency errors. In this paper, an improved method for decimal frequency offset estimation in time domain is proposed. In addition, lots of simulations have proved that when the decimal frequency offset in data streams approaches 0.5 of the subcarrier spacing, a wrong estimated frequency offset with inverse polarity will be presented, and therefore, a novel adjusting model to deal with this problem is also proposed in this paper. Simulation results show that the mean square error (MSE) can be significantly improved by over three orders of magnitude at high SNR with the proposed method compared with the conventional method. The corresponding field programmable gate array (FPGA) circuit through test in HDTV prototype in Team of Engineering Expert Group (TEEG) proves its feasibility and availability.

Microwave and Wireless Components Letters, IEEE	20041004	A new quintupler concept using a heterostructure barrier varactor has been fabricated and measured. The multiplier consists of a quartz circuit mounted in a full height crossed waveguide block, and hence uses a mixture of waveguide components and microstrip elements. The embedding impedance for the fundamental frequency is provided by tuneable backshorts, whereas conventional microstrip circuit elements are used for impedance matching for the third and fifth harmonic.

1297	Integrated bake/chill module with in situ temperature measurement for photoresist processing	Tay, A.; Weng-Khuen Ho; Ai-Poh Loh; Khiang-Wee Lim; Tan, W.-W.; Schaper, Charles D.	Semiconductor Manufacturing, IEEE Transactions on	20040510	Thermal processing of photoresist are critical steps in the microlithography sequence. The postexpose bake (PEB) steps for current DUV chemically amplified resists is especially sensitive to temperature variations. The problem is complicated with increasing wafer size and decreasing feature size. Conventional thermal systems are no longer able to meet these stringent requirements. The reason is that the large thermal mass of conventional hot plates prevents rapid movements in substrate temperature to compensate for real-time errors during transients. The implementation of advanced control systems with conventional technology cannot overcome the inherent operating limitation. An integrated bake/chill module with in situ temperature measurement capability has been developed for the baking of 300-mm silicon wafers. The system provides in situ sensing of the substrate temperature. Real-time closed-loop control of the substrate temperature is thus possible as oppose to conventional open-loop control of the substrate temperature.

1298	Behavioral Adaptive Autonomy. A milestone on the Alife route to AI?		Artificial Life IX:Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems	20121008	While central to robotics, biology and cognitive science, the concept of autonomy remains still difficult to make operative in the realm of Alife simulation models of cognitive agents. Its deep significance as a transition concept between life and cognition (a milestone on the Alife route to AI) remains obscured in the intricate relation between metabolic/constructive processes and behavioral adaptive processes in living systems. Within a naturalized and biologically inspired dynamical approach to cognition a definition of behavioral adaptive autonomy is provided: homeo-static maintenance of essential variables under viability constraints through self-modulating behavioral coupling with the environment, hierarchically decoupled from metabolic (constructive) processes. This definition allows for a naturalized notion of behavioral adaptive functionality (that defines a proper level of modelling within Alife), structurally and interactively emergent: the mapping of the agent-environment system's state space trajectories into the viability subspace of the essential variables of the organism.								
1299	Engineering in genomics: the emerging in-silico scientist; how text-based bioinformatics is bridging biology and artificial intelligence	Garner, H.	Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, IEEE	20040712	Current work in text-based bioinformatics has both immediate and future applications. It has been said that AI has not lived up to its promise, in part because AI is most successful at performing tasks that humans perform poorly and least successful at tasks where humans excel. That is, they excel at tasks such as classification and recognition, but have not been successful in employing methods of logic and reason-the traits we most closely associate with human intelligence. Perhaps AI needs to meet the grand challenges of biomedicine before it can be truly appreciated.	,Artificial intelligence;Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Bridges;Chemical technology;Computational modeling;Data mining;Databases;Text mining,biology computing;data mining;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;medical expert systemsartificial intelligence;expert systems;genomics;knowledge discovery;knowledge representation;reasoning;text data mining;text-based bioinformaticsAbstracting and Indexing as Topic;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biology;Computational Biology;Database Management Systems;Databases, Bibliographic;Genomics;Information Storage and Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;Periodicals as Topic;Vocabulary, Controlled							
1300	Improved method for determining inversion layer mobility of electrons in trench MOSFETs	van den Heuvel, M.G.L.; Hueting, R.J.E.; Hijzen, E.A.; Zandt, M.A.Ai.	Circuits, Devices and Systems, IEE Proceedings -	20040621	Trench sidewall effective electron mobility (?eff) values were determined by using the split capacitance-voltage (CV) method for a large range of the transversal effective field (Eeff) from 0.1 up to 1.4 MV/cm. The influences of crystal orientation, doping concentration and, for the first time, temperature were investigated. Results show that the split CV method is an accurate method for determining ?eff (Eeff) data in trench MOSFETs; the {100} ?eff data approaches published data on planar MOSFETs for high Eeff; and mobility behaviour can be explained with generally accepted scattering models for the entire range of Eeff. The results are important for the optimisation of trench power devices.	diffusion;insulated gate bipolar transistors;matrix convertors;power semiconductor switches50 A;600 V;bidirectional switch;deep boron diffusion;insulated gate bipolar transistors;matrix converter;reverse blocking IGBT;reverse blocking capability;trade-off performance improvement;ultra-thin wafer technology							
1301	Optimal levels of perturbation signals for nonlinear system identification	Barker, H.A.; Ai Hui Tan; Godfrey, K.R.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20040816	A method is developed for determining the optimal levels of multilevel perturbation signals for nonlinear system identification, using condition numbers of submatrices of the Vandermonde matrix of the input levels vector. It is applicable when the perturbation signal is applied directly to a static nonlinearity. Optimal levels can be obtained for every order of nonlinearity less than the number of levels, and in most cases the optimal levels are not all distinct. The results show that there is no advantage in using signals with more than the minimum necessary number of distinct levels, although it may be advantageous if some of the distinct levels appear more than once in the input levels vector. The optimal levels are unchanged by multiple occurrences of every level of the input levels vector during a measurement period, and they are shown to be the global optima for pseudorandom perturbation signals derived from maximum-length sequences, in which the occurrence of the zero level is one less than the occurrences of the other levels during a period.

1303	Influence of AC magnetic field amplitude on the surface magnetoimpedance tensor in amorphous wire with helical magnetic anisotropy	Chen, A.P.; Britel, M.R.; Zhukova, V.; Zhukov, A.; Dominguez, L.; Chizhik, A.B.; Blanco, J.M.; Gonzalez, J.	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20040913	We have performed experimental and theoretical studies on the influence of ac magnetic field amplitude on the magnetoimpedance tensor in an amorphous wire with helical magnetic anisotropy. For the experimental measurements, we used an amorphous wire of composition (Co0.94Fe0.06)72.5Si12.5B15 with negative, nearly zero magnetostriction constant, excited either by an ac circular h? or by an axial hz magnetic field created by an ac electric current. We changed the ac current amplitude from 7.5 to 40 mA and the current frequency f from 1.5 to 20 MHz. The values of the asymmetric giant magnetoimpedance ratio associated with the sweeping direction of the dc field Hex and the corresponding sensitivity were 211% and 0.64 V/Oe, respectively, for an ac current of 37.5 mA at 3 MHz. For the theoretical study based on the magnetization rotation, we obtained the second-order harmonic of the ac magnetization m&oarr;(2) induced by the relatively high ac magnetic field by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. We also considered a second-order surface impedance tensor &sigmav;ﾈ(2), which allowed us to analyze quantitatively the influence of the ac magnetic field amplitude on the impedance tensor of the wire. We obtained the domain model of the wire with helical magnetic anisotropy having multidomains and the magnetization vector ﾱM0 directed in the easy direction, and the corresponding static magnetic configurations, by solving the static LLG equation. For the given magnetic configurations, we calculated the second-order impedance tensor &sigmav;ﾈ(2). The results can well explain the irregular field characteristics of the voltage responses at low dc field value, when the wire was excited at high frequency and at large ac magnetic field.

1304	Hydrogen bonding in hydrogenated amorphous germanium	Abo-Ghazala, M. S.; Hazrny, S. Ai	Tsinghua Science and Technology	20120117	Thin films of hydrogenated amorphous germanium (a-Ge:H) were prepared by radio frequency glow discharge deposition at various substrate temperatures. The hydrogen distribution and bonding structure in a-Ge:H were discussed based on infrared absorption data. The correlation between infrared absorption spectra and hydrogen effusion measurements was used to determine the proportionality constant for each vibration mode of the Ge-H bonds. The results reveal that the bending mode appearing at 835 cm?1 is associated with the Ge-H2 (dihydride) groups on the internal surfaces of voids. While 1880 cm?1 is assigned to vibrations of Ge-H (monohydride) groups in the bulk, the 2000 cm?1 stretching mode is attributed to Ge-H and Ge-H2 bonds located on the surfaces of voids. For films associated with bending modes in the infrared spectra, the proportionality constant values of the stretching modes near 1880 and 2000 cm?1 are found to be lower than those of films which had no corresponding bending modes.	film;hydrogen bonding;hydrogenated amorphous germanium,Absorption;Bonding;Correlation;Films;Microstructure;Thermal stability;Vibrations							
1305	Radar network system to observe & analyze Tokyo Bay vessel traffic	Shun Liu; Hagiwara, H.; Shoji, R.; Tamara, H.; Okano, T.	Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, IEEE	20041213	A complete grasp of the actual vessel traffic flow by accurate observation is essential to carry out vessel traffic management, design of vessel traffic route, plan of port construction, etc. Up to now, the observation of vessel traffic has needed many efforts such as the use of a special ship or car equipped with radar observation systems and the observation staff preparation for a considerably long period. In order to perform accurate observation of vessel traffic without such efforts, the authors have developed a completely automated radar network system covering the main traffic route of Tokyo Bay. In August 2003, as the second remote radar station attaching AIS equipment was set at East Ogishima (the first was installed at the National Defense Academy in 2002), the observing range could be enlarged and cover most traffic routes in Tokyo Bay. These two radars can observe the vessel traffic in Tokyo Bay simultaneously so as to know the traffic flow accurately on the basis of analyzing the integrated radar data. In addition to the development of a radar network system, the software to analyze observed vessel traffic flow has been developed. This software has various functions such as tracking of ship's position, automatic determination of ship's size, animation of ship's movements, superposition of successive radar images, display of ship's tracks, calculation of ship's speed distribution, extraction of dangerous ship encounters using subjective judgment value and bumper model, etc. Some analyzed results on vessel traffic flow observed by the remote radars in January and September 2003 are shown in this paper.	,Animation;Displays;Joining processes;Marine vehicles;Radar equipment;Radar imaging;Radar tracking;Software systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,marine radar;marine systems;radar computing;radar imaging;radar tracking;traffic controlAIS equipment;East Ogishima;Tokyo Bay;automated radar network system;bumper model;integrated radar data;port construction plan;position tracking;radar images;radar observation systems;remote radar station;ship movement animation;ship size determination;speed distribution;subjective judgment value;vessel traffic flow;vessel traffic management;vessel traffic route design

Electronics Letters	20040315	A unified algorithm to compute modular division in both GF(p) and GF(2n) fields is presented. It uses a counter variable to keep track of the difference between two field elements, and in this way eliminates the need for comparisons which are usually expensive and time-consuming. The computations in both fields are performed using additions/subtractions and bit shifts, besides using a simple control flow, which makes it suitable for hardware implementation.

The proposed technique for the stator ground fault detection simultaneously takes into account the fault contributed zero sequence fundamental voltage and the fault contributed third-harmonic voltage (?-zero sequence voltage). The effect of the start-up component based on the wavelet transform is also highlighted. As information both on the fault contributed zero sequence fundamental voltage and the third-harmonic voltage is used simultaneously, the scheme can obtain higher sensitivity. Results from the experiment and in the field show that the proposed technique can detect the ground fault with high sensitivity and reliability during all operating conditions.	coils;electric generators;fault diagnosis;harmonic distortion;harmonics suppression;machine protection;reliability;stators;wavelet transforms?-zero sequence voltages;coils;fault contributed third-harmonic voltage;fundamental voltage;generator fault;mathematical model;protection technique;reliable operating conditions;sensitivity;start-up component;stator ground fault detection;wavelet transform

We define a new interface between the serving GPRS support node and the cell broadcast center to track the current locations of the multicast members. Then we describe the location tracking procedures (including attach, detach, and location update) of the multicast members and the multicast message delivery procedure. We use an analytic model to investigate the performance of our approach.

1309	Laser trapping and patterning of protein microcrystals: Toward highly integrated protein microarrays	Hosokawa, Yoichiroh; Matsumura, Satoshi; Masuhara, Hiroshi; Ikeda, Keiko; Shimo-oka, Ai; Mori, Hajime	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Some insect virus infections occlude into a crystalline matrix consisting of a protein named polyhedrin. The shape of the matrix is a cubic polyhedron of the size of a few micrometers. Recently it was shown that these polyhedra could immobilize various functional proteins within them. Therefore, the polyhedron is interesting as an element in a protein chip. In this work, individual polyhedra were arrayed and bonded under a microscope by focused laser beams, with the aim of fabricating a highly integrated protein chip. The polyhedron was trapped and transferred to a suitable position on a polymer substrate by optical trapping with a 1064ﾠnmﾠNd3+:YAG (YAG, yttrium aluminum garnet) laser. To bond the polyhedron on the substrate, the polymer surface was mechanically and chemically modified by multiphoton absorption of a 120ﾠfs, ﾠ800ﾠnm femtosecond Ti: sapphire laser, which results in strong adhesion of the polyhedron to the substrate. The arraying and bonding of polyhedra were successful, to a precision of about 1ﾠ?m, with this procedure. The biological activity of polyhedra after these laser irradiations was confirmed by the fluorescence of green fluorescent protein occluded in the polyhedrin matrix.	adhesion;arrays;bio-optics;biomolecular effects of radiation;fluorescence;high-speed optical techniques;laser ablation;microorganisms;proteins;radiation pressure8714Ee;8715Mi,							
1310	The JSAI and AI activity in Japan	Mizoguchi, R.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20050404	Japan has a long history of AI research, in fact, research on computer vision and natural language processing was already in progress in the early seventies. However, two events that started Japan's wave of AI research were the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in Tokyo in 1979 and the Fifth Generation Computer System Project which the Ministry of International Trade and Industries started in 1982. Both events greatly impacted Japanese AI research-especially the FGCS project, a 10-year national project to build an inference machine based on logic programming. Japan established its Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence in 1986. JSAI has about 3,500 members and several special-interest groups. It publishes bimonthly online journals and transactions. JSAI recently established a new technical paper category called AI Frontier. This category has distinct evaluation criteria: papers must deeply impress the six expert evaluators. JSAI established the Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in 1990 to complement IJCAI and the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence.	,Artificial intelligence;Asia;Data mining;Humans;Intelligent robots;Intelligent systems;Knowledge management;Machine learning;Ontologies;Semantic Web,artificial intelligence;expert systemsAI Frontier;Fifth Generation Computer System Project;IJCAI;International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence;JSAI;Japanese AI research;Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence;computer vision;inference machine;logic programming;natural language processing;online journal							
1311	Development of hybrid genetic algorithms for product line designs	Balakrishnan, P.V.; Gupta, R.; Jacob, V.S.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20040130	In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) based meta-heuristic techniques namely genetic algorithms (GAs), for the product line design problem. This work extends previously developed methods for the single product design problem. We conduct a large scale simulation study to determine the effectiveness of such an AI based technique for providing good solutions and bench mark the performance of this against the current dominant approach of beam search (BS). We investigate the potential advantages of pursuing the avenue of developing hybrid models and then implement and study such hybrid models using two very distinct approaches: namely, seeding the initial GA population with the BS solution, and employing the BS solution as part of the GA operator's process. We go on to examine the impact of two alternate string representation formats on the quality of the solutions obtained by the above proposed techniques. We also explicitly investigate a critical managerial factor of attribute importance in terms of its impact on the solutions obtained by the alternate modeling procedures. The alternate techniques are then evaluated, using statistical analysis of variance, on a fairly large number of data sets, as to the quality of the solutions obtained with respect to the state-of-the-art benchmark and in terms of their ability to provide multiple, unique product line options.	,Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Genetic algorithms;Insurance;Jacobian matrices;Large-scale systems;Market research;Mathematical programming;Product design;Statistical analysis,genetic algorithms;heuristic programming;product design;production management;search problems;statistical analysisAI based meta-heuristic techniques;GA;artificial intelligence;beam search;critical managerial factor;hybrid genetic algorithm;marketing;product line design problem;string representation formats							
1312	Record low specific on-resistance for low-voltage trench MOSFETs	Zandt, M.A.Ai.; Hijzen, E.A.; Hueting, R.J.E.; Koops, G.E.J.	Circuits, Devices and Systems, IEE Proceedings -	20040621	A process is shown by which both the specific on-resistance Rds,on and the gate-drain charge density Qgd can be reduced. Reduction of Rds,on is achieved by optimising the channel profile (p-body) towards a more box-shaped profile. Qgd is reduced by reducing the gate-trench widths below the I-line lithography limits, without using deep-UV lithography. For polygonal cell structures, it is shown that trench width reduction also gives further Rds,on reduction. Record values for Rds,on of 4 m?ﾷmm2 (at Vgs=10 V) have been obtained for a 20 V trench MOSFET with a 2 ?m cell pitch. Furthermore, for a 30 V trench MOSFET with a 2 ?m cell pitch, an Rds,on of 7 m?ﾷmm2 (at Vgs=10 V) was obtained by using a more box-shaped p-body profile.	power integrated circuits;power semiconductor devices;semiconductor technologyCambridge;England;high voltages power electronics;low voltages power electronics;power devices;power integrated circuit technology;radio frequency devices;semiconductor technology

1314	Thermal constraints for heterostructure barrier varactors	Ingvarson, M.; Alderman, B.; Olsen, Ai.; Vukusic, J.; Stake, J.	Electron Device Letters, IEEE	20041025	Current research on heterostructure barrier varactors (HBVs) devotes much effort to the generation of very high power levels in the millimeter wave region. One way of increasing the power handling capacity of HBVs is to stack several barriers epitaxially. However, the small device dimensions lead to very high temperatures in the active layers, deteriorating the performance. We have derived analytical expressions and combined those with finite element simulations, and used the results to predict the maximum effective number of barriers for HBVs. The thermal model is also used to compare the peak temperature and power handling capacity of GaAs and InP-based HBVs. It is argued that InP-based devices may be inappropriate for high-power applications due to the poor thermal conductivity of the InGaAs modulation layers.

1316	A fuzzy ARTMAP fault classifier for impulse testing of power transformers	De, A.; Chatterjee, N.	Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, IEEE Transactions on	20050131	The work presents an artificial intelligence (AI) based impulse test technique for oil filled power transformers. Determination of exact nature and location of faults, during impulse testing of large power transformer is of practical importance to the transformer manufacturers as well as designers. The presently available impulse test techniques more or less depend on expertise of the test personnel, and in many cases lead to ambiguity and controversy. The new AI approach presented in the paper overcomes the limitations of conventional test methods. This new technique relies on high discrimination power and excellent generalization ability of fuzzy neural networks in complex pattern classification problem. The proposed method employs a fuzzy ARTMAP pattern recognition technique to recognize the frequency responses of the winding admittance of high voltage transformers under healthy and different faulty conditions of winding insulation, and learns to establish the correlations between the nature and physical location of occurrence of an internal insulation fault in a transformer winding and its associated frequency response. The technique was tested on the winding model of typical high voltage transformer and yielded high diagnostic accuracy by successful detection and discrimination of faults of different nature and different site of occurrence in the high voltage winding.	,Artificial intelligence;Impulse testing;Manufacturing;Oil insulation;Pattern recognition;Personnel;Petroleum;Power transformer insulation;Power transformers;Voltage transformers,electric admittance;electric breakdown;fault location;frequency response;fuzzy neural nets;generalisation (artificial intelligence);impulse testing;insulation testing;pattern recognition;power engineering computing;power transformer insulation;power transformer testing;transformer oil;transformer windingsAI;artificial intelligence;complex pattern classification problem;dielectric test;fault diagnosis;faults location;frequency responses;fuzzy ARTMAP fault classifier;fuzzy neural networks;generalization ability;high voltage transformer winding;high voltage transformers;impulse test technique;insulation breakdown;internal insulation fault;lightning impulse;oil filled power transformers;pattern recognition technique;transformer manufacturers;winding admittance;winding insulation

BLaT thin films showed a first-order para-ferroelectric transition around 400 ﾰC. Pt/BLaT/Pt capacitors post-annealed in Ar exhibited broadened transition with larger losses, which was interpreted in terms of increased oxygen vacancies. Via complex impedance spectroscopy study, the conduction activation energy of the space charges was determined to be ?1.1 eV, close to that of oxygen vacancies in perovskite materials. The impedance characteristics of Pt/BLaT/Pt were compared with those of Pt/SrBi2Ta2O9(SBT)/Pt capacitors. The impact of dielectric characteristics on fatigue resistance of BLaT films was briefly discussed in comparison with SBT films. ﾩ 2004 American Institute of Physics.	annealing;bismuth compounds;dielectric hysteresis;ferroelectric capacitors;ferroelectric transitions;lanthanum compounds;permittivity;platinum;space charge;thin film capacitors7722Ch;7722Jp;7780Bh;7780Dj;7784Dy;8140Gh;8432Tt;8550-n,

Using a codebook of CO3s from an independent training set of 100 writers, the probability-density function (PDF) of CC's was computed for an independent test set containing 150 unseen writers. Results revealed a high-sensitivity of the CO3 PDF for identifying individual writers on the basis of a single sentence of uppercase characters. The proposed automatic approach bridges the gap between image-statistics approaches on one end and manually measured allograph features of individual characters on the other end. Combining the CO3 PDF with an independent edge-based orientation and curvature PDF yielded very high correct identification rates.

1323	Structure and electrical properties of Bi3.15Nd0.85Ti3O12 ferroelectric thin films	Wu, Di; Li, Aidong; Ming, Naiben	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Polycrystalline Bi3.15Nd0.85Ti3O12 (BNdT) ferroelectric thin films were deposited on platinized Si substrates by chemical solution deposition. Dense and uniform BNdT films with pure Bi-layered perovskite structure were achieved by rapid thermal annealing the spin-on films at 700 ﾰC for 3 min. Well-saturated hysteresis loops with remanent polarization around 10 ?C/cm2 were obtained on Pt/BNdT/Pt capacitors. Typical values of dielectric constant and loss tangent of BNdT films at 10 kHz were 525 and 0.028, respectively. Curie temperature of BNdT films was determined to be around 450 ﾰC from temperature dependent dielectric measurement. Pt/BNdT/Pt capacitors showed excellent fatigue resistance with no polarization reduction up to 1010 switches. Imprints, shifts of hysteresis loops along voltage axis, were observed along with the loss of retained polarization after heat treatment of poled Pt/BNdT/Pt capacitors. However, data loss due to imprint is negligible for BNdT capacitors. The dc leakage current density of BNdT capacitors is in the order of 10-7ﾖ10-6 A/cm2 below 100 kV/cm. ﾩ 2004 American Institute of Physics.

1324	Serving radio network controller relocation for UMTS all-IP network	Ai-Chun Pang; Yi-Bing Lin; Hsien-Ming Tsai; Agrawal, P.	Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on	20040504	To support real-time multimedia services in UMTS all-IP network, Third-Generation Partnership Project TR 25.936 proposed two approaches to support real-time serving radio network controller (SRNC) switching, which require packet duplication during SRNC relocation. These approaches significantly consume extra system resources. This paper proposes the fast SRNC relocation (FSR) approach that does not duplicate packets. In FSR, a packet buffering mechanism is implemented to avoid packet loss at the target RNC. We propose an analytic model to investigate the performance of FSR. The numerical results show that packet loss at the source RNC can be ignored. Furthermore, the expected number of packets buffered at the target RNC is small, which does not prolong packet delay.	,3G mobile communication;Computer science;Delay;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Ground penetrating radar;Multimedia systems;Radio control;Radio network;Random variables,3G mobile communication;IP networks;mobile radio;multimedia communication;packet radio networks;packet switching;telecommunication controlIP network;UMTS;fast serving radio network;packet buffering mechanism;packet duplication;real-time multimedia service;serving radio network controller switching relocation;third-generation partnership project;universal mobile telecommunication system

Electronics Letters	20040920	A compact design of a single-feed circularly polarised (CP) microstrip antenna with relaxed manufacturing tolerances is presented. The CP operation of the microstrip antenna is achieved using a cross slot embedded on the radiating patch. By cutting an additional cross slot on the ground plane, not only the CP operating frequency can be decreased but also the slot-length ratio of the cross slot on the radiating patch can be considerably increased. In addition, the performance of the proposed design, such as CP bandwidth and peak gain, have no significant reduction.	antenna feeds;electromagnetic wave polarisation;microstrip antennas;slot antennascircularly polarised microstrip antenna design;circularly polarised operating frequency;cross slot;ground plane;manufacturing tolerances;radiating patch;single feed microstrip antenna;slot-length ratio

The room-temperature conductivity is 8.6�10-2 S/cm for PANI�NSA microspheres (0.8�2 ?m in outer diameter) and 5.6�10-4 S/cm for PANI�SA microspheres (3�7 ?m in outer diameter). The conductivity of an individual PANI�SA microsphere is measured directly by a two-probe technique, about 8�10-2 S/cm (which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of a PANI�SA microsphere�s pellet). The measurements of conductivity, I�V curve, and magnetoresistance demonstrate that the electrical properties of PANI microspheres are dominated by the intersphere contacts due to the sample�s microscopic inhomogeneity. � 2004 American Institute of Physics.	conducting polymers;electrical conductivity;magnetoresistance;organic semiconductors;self-assembly6141+e;7220My;7280Le;8105Lg;8116Dn,							
1329	Nonlinear control of feedforward systems with bounded signals	Kaliora, G.; Astolfi, A.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20041115	"The stabilization problem for a class of nonlinear feedforward systems is solved using bounded control. It is shown that when the lower subsystem of the cascade is input-to-state stable and the upper subsystem not exponentially unstable, global asymptotic stability can be achieved via a simple static feedback having bounded amplitude that requires knowledge of the ""upper"" part of the state only. This is made possible by invoking the bounded real lemma and a generalization of the small gain theorem. Thus, stabilization is achieved with typical saturation functions, saturations of constant sign, or quantized control. Moreover, the problem of asymptotic stabilization of a stable linear system with bounded outputs is solved by means of dynamic feedback. Finally, a new class of stabilizing control laws for a chain of integrators with input saturation is proposed. Some robustness issues are also addressed and the theory is illustrated with examples on the stabilization of physical systems."	65;Bounded control;bounded-real lemma;forwarding;nonlinear stabilization,Asymptotic stability;Control systems;Feedforward systems;Linear systems;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear equations;Output feedback;Robustness;State feedback,asymptotic stability;feedback;feedforward;linear systems;nonlinear control systemsbounded control;bounded real lemma;dynamic feedback;feedforward system;global asymptotic stability;linear system;nonlinear control system;small gain theorem

1331	Gate-drain charge analysis for switching in power trench MOSFETs	Hueting, R.J.E.; Hijzen, E.A.; Heringa, A.; Ludikhuize, A.W.; Zandt, M.A.Ai.	Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on	20040726	For the switching performance of low-voltage (LV) power MOSFETs, the gate-drain charge density (Qgd) is an important parameter. The so-called figure-of-merit, which is defined as the product of the specific on-resistance (Rds,on) and Qgd is commonly used for quantifying the switching performance for a specified off-state breakdown voltage (BVds). In this paper, we analyzed the switching behavior in power trench MOSFETs by using experiments and simulations, focusing on the charge density Qgd. The results of this analysis can be used for further optimization of these devices. The results show that the Qd can be split into three charge contributions: accumulation, depletion, and inversion charge. It is shown that the inversion charge is located mainly underneath the trench bottom. The accumulation and depletion charge contribute each about 45% in conventional LV trench MOSFETs and can be reduced by using a thick bottom oxide in a shallow trench gate just extending in the drift region. Further, we derived an analytical model for calculating the Qgd, that takes into account the geometry dependence.

Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on	20040712	"Weather forecasting has been one of the most challenging problems around the world for more than half a century. Not only because of its practical value in meteorology, but it is also a typical ""unbiased"" time series forecasting problem in scientific research. In this paper, we propose an innovative, intelligent multiagent-based environment, namely intelligent Java Agent Development Environment (iJADE), to provide an integrated and intelligent agent-based platform in the e-commerce environment. In addition to the facilities found in contemporary agent development platforms, which focus on the autonomy and mobility of the multiagents, iJADE provides an intelligent layer (known as the ""conscious layer"") to implement various AI functionalities in order to produce ""smart"" agents. From an implementation point of view, we introduce a weather forecasting system known as iJADE WeatherMAN - a weather forecasting system that uses fuzzy-neuro-based intelligent agents for automatic weather information gathering and filtering, and for time series weather prediction. Compared with the previous studies on single point sources using a similar network and other networks, such as the radial basis function network, learning vector quantization and the Na�ve Bayesian network, our experimental results are very promising. This neural-based rainfall forecasting system is useful and can be used in parallel with traditional forecast methods that are used at the Hong Kong Observatory."	,Artificial intelligence;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Information filtering;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Java;Meteorology;Weather forecasting,Java;fuzzy neural nets;geophysics computing;information filters;multi-agent systems;software agents;time series;weather forecastingBayesian network;agent development platforms;e-commerce environment;iJADE WeatherMAN;intelligent Java agent development environment;intelligent agent-based platform;intelligent multiagent-based fuzzy neuro network;neural-based rainfall forecasting system;radial basis function network;time series forecasting problem;vector quantization;weather forecasting system

Launched in the summer of 2003, each rover carries instruments for conducting remote and in site observations to elucidate the planet's past climate, water activity, and habitability. Science is MER's primary driver, so making best use of the scientific instruments, within the available resources, is a crucial aspect of the mission. To address this criticality, the MER project team selected MAPGEN (mixed initiative activity plan generator) as an activity-planning tool. MAPGEN combines two existing systems, each with a strong heritage: the APGEN activity-planning tool from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Europa planning and scheduling system from NASA Ames Research Center. We discuss the issues arising from combining these tools in this mission's context.

1334	Design of multilevel perturbation signals with harmonic properties suitable for nonlinear system identification	Barker, H.A.; Tan, A.H.; Godfrey, K.R.	Control Theory and Applications, IEE Proceedings -	20040419	A method is described for determining the levels of multilevel pseudorandom perturbation signals generated from maximum-length sequences in Galois fields that give the signals the desirable characteristics that their even harmonics are suppressed and their odd harmonics are uniform. The method uses the fact that a short sequence comprised of the signal levels converted from the nonzero field elements taken in a particular order must have corresponding characteristics. Analytical expressions are obtained for the signal level conversions that are necessary for the signal to possess these characteristics. The results are tabulated in symbolic form for 3-level, 5-level and 7-level signals generated in the fields GF(3), GF(5), GF(7), GF(9), GF(11) and GF(13). The method is then extended to signals in which harmonic multiples of 2 and 3 are suppressed and nonzero harmonics are uniform, and similar results are tabulated for GF(7) and GF(13). An example is used to illustrate the application of the results.

Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures	20090618	The notching (undercutting or footing) and stiction problem, which widely exists in silicon-on-insulator microstructure were resolved in this study regardless of the feature sizes, by the introduction of a spacer oxide thin film. In this modified process, the deep reactive ion etching was divided into several steps, where conformal plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition oxide coating, and anisotropic oxide etch were employed to prevent the notching effect. Dry chemical release was also realized in this approach but the deep etching did not etch through the device layer. The notching or footing effect was exploited for attaining the lateral etching following the deployment of the anisotropic plasma etching of the inductively coupled plasma. This method was proven useful for both the uniform and nonuniform feature designs. To validate the proposed etching method, an optical switch was fabricated. The details and benefits of the proposed process and its extensions to more valuable and flexible design were all discussed in this article. ﾩ 2003 American Vacuum Society.	conformal coatings;micromechanical devices;plasma CVD coatings;silicon-on-insulator;sputter etching;stiction5277Bn;5277Dq;7340Qv;8115Gh;8165Cf;8585+j,

1344	A resolution-like strategy based on a lattice-valued logic	Jun Liu; Da Ruan; Yang Xu; Zhenming Song	Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20030811	As the use of nonclassical logics becomes increasingly important in computer science, artificial intelligence and logic programming, the development of efficient automated theorem proving based on nonclassical logic is currently an active area of research. This paper aims at the resolution principle for the Pavelka type fuzzy logic (1979). Pavelka showed that the only natural way of formalizing fuzzy logic for truth-values in the unit interval [0, 1] is by using the Lukasiewicz's implication operator a?b=min{1,1-a+b} or some isomorphic forms of it. Hence, we first focus on the resolution principle for the Lukasiewicz logic L&aleph; with [0, 1] as the truth-valued set. Some limitations of classical resolution and resolution procedures for fuzzy logic with Kleene implication are analyzed. Then some preliminary ideals about combining resolution procedure with the implication connectives in L&aleph; are given. Moreover, a resolution-like principle in L&aleph; is proposed and the soundness theorem of this resolution procedure is also proved. Second, we use this resolution-like principle to Horn clauses with truth-values in an enriched residuated lattice and consider the L-type fuzzy Prolog.	,Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Expert systems;Fuzzy logic;Knowledge engineering;Lattices;Logic programming;Mathematics;Proposals,formal logic;fuzzy logic;theorem provingAI;Pavelka type fuzzy logic;artificial intelligence;computer science;efficient automated theorem proving;lattice-valued logic;logic programming;nonclassical logics;resolution-like strategy							
1345	Why neural computing? a personal view		Neural Computing Architectures:The Design of Brain-Like Machines	20120924	The sudden growth of interest in neural computing is a remarkable phenomenon that will be seen by future historians of computer science as marking the 1980s in much the same way as research into artificial intelligence (AI) has been the trademark of the 19705. There is one major difference, however: in contrast with AI, which was largely an outlet for a minority of computer scientists, neural computing unites a very broad community: physicists, statisticians, parallel processing experts, optical technologists, neuro physiologists and experimental biologists. The focus of this new paradigm is rather simple. It rests on the recognition by this diverse community that the brain ﾑcomputesﾒ in a very different way from the conventional computer. This is quite contrary to the focus of the AI paradigm, which is based on the premise that an understanding of what the brain does represents a true understanding only if it can be explicitly expressed as a set of rules that, in turn, can be run on a computer which subsequently performs artificially intelligent tasks. Those who contribute to neural computing believe that the brain, given sensors and a body, builds up its own hidden rules through what is usually called ﾑexperienceﾒ. When a person activates his muscles in complex sequences driven by signals from his eyes, from sensory receptors in his muscles and even from his ears when performing an every-day act such as getting on a bus, or when he notices a ﾑpolite chillﾒ in a colleague's voice, these are examples of large numbers of implicit rules at work in a simultaneous and coordinated fashion in the brain. In neural computing it is believed that the cellular structures within which such rules can grow and be executed are the focus of important study as opposed to the AI concern of trying to extract the rules in order to run them on a computer. Neural computing is thus concerned with a class of machines that compute by absorbing experience, and in that sense is a class which includes the brain, but may include other forms with similar properties. It is for reasons of extending interest to these other forms that we have chosen to use the word architectures in the title of this book. Its authors are not latter-day Frankensteins in the business of making brains. They are, however, united in trying to understand computing structures that are brain-like in the sense that they acquire knowledge through experience rather than preprogramming. So, Neural Computinq Architectures is not about the details of mimicking the neurons of the brain and their interconnections, but more about the nature of the broad class of machines which behave in brain-like ways and, through this, adding to both our armoury of knowledge in computing and to our ability to apply such knowledge through the design of novel machinery. Perhaps, from all this it may be possible to draw out a definition of neural computing: Neural computinq is th e study of cellular networks that have a natural propensity for storinq experiential knowledqe. Such systems hear a resemblance to the brain in the sense that knowledge is acquired through traininq rather than programming and is retained due to chanqes in node functions. The knowledge takes the form of stable states or cycles of states in the operation of the net. A central property of such nets is to recall these states or cycles in response to the presentation of cues.

1347	High-fidelity multichannel audio coding with Karhunen-Loeve transform	Yang, Dai; Ai, Hongmei; Kyriakakis, Chris; Kuo, C.-C.J.	Speech and Audio Processing, IEEE Transactions on	20030728	A new quality-scalable high-fidelity multichannel audio compression algorithm based on MPEG-2 advanced audio coding (AAC) is presented. The Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) is applied to multichannel audio signals in the preprocessing stage to remove interchannel redundancy. Then, signals in decorrelated channels are compressed by a modified AAC main profile encoder. Finally, a channel transmission control mechanism is used to re-organize the bitstream so that the multichannel audio bitstream has a quality scalable property when it is transmitted over a heterogeneous network. Experimental results show that, compared with AAC, the proposed algorithm achieves a better performance while maintaining a similar computational complexity at the regular bit rate of 64 kbit/sec/ch. When the bitstream is transmitted to narrowband end users at a lower bit rate, packets in some channels can be dropped, and slightly degraded, yet full-channel, audio can still be reconstructed in a reasonable fashion without any additional computational cost.	,Audio coding;Audio compression;Bit rate;Computational complexity;Decorrelation;Degradation;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Mechanical factors;Narrowband;Transform coding,Karhunen-Loeve transforms;audio coding;computational complexity;signal reconstruction;transform coding64 kbit/s;Karhunen-Loeve transform;MPEG-2 AAC;MPEG-2 advanced audio coding;audio bitstream;audio compression;audio signal reconstruction;computational complexity;decorrelated channels;heterogeneous network;high-fidelity audio coding;interchannel redundancy;multichannel audio coding							
1348	Identification of direction-dependent processes using maximum length ternary signals	Tan, A.H.	Control Theory and Applications, IEE Proceedings -	20030415	Analytical results have been obtained for first-order direction-dependent processes perturbed using maximum length ternary (MLT) signals. In particular, the process output and the input-output crosscorrelation function are derived, leading to a theoretical expression for the combined time constant of the process. The importance of doing this is that the direction-dependent behaviour can be detected, and the combined linear dynamics of the process can be estimated, from the input-output crosscorrelation function. In the above derivations, it is assumed that the process dynamics are faster in the upward direction, and that the clock-pulse interval is chosen such that the output always decreases when the input is at signal level zero. The first of these assumptions does not affect the terms in the crosscorrelation function because the input signal is inverse-repeat. The second assumption is shown to be valid during most of the signal period. The errors caused by the deviation from the ideal case are assessed, and are found to be small. Hence, the ideal case can be used as an effective benchmark against which results from an identification test as specified above can be measured. Advantages and disadvantages of using the MLT signal, instead of the maximum length binary or its inverse-repeat signal, are discussed. A simulation example is also shown to verify the obtained theoretical results.	control system analysis;identification;process controlclock-pulse interval;direction dependent behaviour;direction-dependent processes;direction-dependent processes identification;input-output crosscorrelation function;linear dynamics;maximum length ternary signals;process dynamics

1351	Adaptive control of discrete time systems with concave/convex parametrizations	Loh, A.P.; Qu, C.Y.; Fong, K.F.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20030620	This note considers the adaptive control of a class of nonlinear discrete time system with concave/convex parametrizations. The solutions involved two tuning functions which are determined by a minmax optimization approach much like the continuous time counterparts found in the literature. Direct extension from the continuous time case do not work very well due to the premature termination of the adaptive algorithm before zero tracking error can be achieved. In this note, this problem is solved. The proposed algorithm is shown to be stable and achieves zero tracking error in steady state.	,Adaptive algorithm;Adaptive control;Control systems;Convergence;Discrete time systems;Lyapunov method;Minimax techniques;Nonlinear control systems;Stability;Steady-state,adaptive control;discrete time systemsadaptive control;discrete time systems;minmax optimization;nonlinear parametrization							
1352	Immersion and invariance: a new tool for stabilization and adaptive control of nonlinear systems	Astolfi, A.; Ortega, R.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20030415	A new method to design asymptotically stabilizing and adaptive control laws for nonlinear systems is presented. The method relies upon the notions of system immersion and manifold invariance and, in principle, does not require the knowledge of a (control) Lyapunov function. The construction of the stabilizing control laws resembles the procedure used in nonlinear regulator theory to derive the (invariant) output zeroing manifold and its friend. The method is well suited in situations where we know a stabilizing controller of a nominal reduced order model, which we would like to robustify with respect to higher order dynamics. This is achieved by designing a control law that asymptotically immerses the full system dynamics into the reduced order one. We also show that in adaptive control problems the method yields stabilizing schemes that counter the effect of the uncertain parameters adopting a robustness perspective. Our construction does not invoke certainty equivalence, nor requires a linear parameterization, furthermore, viewed from a Lyapunov perspective, it provides a procedure to add cross terms between the parameter estimates and the plant states. Finally, it is shown that the proposed approach is directly applicable to systems in feedback and feedforward form, yielding new stabilizing control laws. We illustrate the method with several academic and practical examples, including a mechanical system with flexibility modes, an electromechanical system with parasitic actuator dynamics and an adaptive nonlinearly parameterized visual servoing application.	,Adaptive control;Control systems;Counting circuits;Design methodology;Lyapunov method;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear systems;Reduced order systems;Regulators;Robust control,Lyapunov methods;adaptive control;asymptotic stability;control system synthesis;feedback;feedforward;nonlinear control systems;uncertain systemsLyapunov perspective;adaptive control;adaptive nonlinearly parameterized visual servoing;asymptotically stabilizing control law design;certainty equivalence;cross terms;electromechanical system;feedback;feedforward;high-order dynamics;immersion;invariance;linear parameterization;manifold invariance;matching conditions;nonlinear regulator theory;nonlinear systems;parasitic actuator dynamics;stabilization;system immersion;uncertain parameters

1357	Constructivist AI		Made-Up Minds:A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence	20120924	Made-Up Minds addresses fundamental questions of learning and concept invention by means of an innovative computer program that is based on the cognitive-developmental theory of psychologist Jean Piaget. Drescher uses Piaget's theory as a source of inspiration for the design of an artificial cognitive system called the schema mechanism, and then uses the system to elaborate and test Piaget's theory. The approach is original enough that readers need not have extensive knowledge of artificial intelligence, and a chapter summarizing Piaget assists readers who lack a background in developmental psychology. The schema mechanism learns from its experiences, expressing discoveries in its existing representational vocabulary, and extending that vocabulary with new concepts. A novel empirical learning technique, marginal attribution, can find results of an action that are obscure because each occurs rarely in general, although reliably under certain conditions. Drescher shows that several early milestones in the Piagetian infant's invention of the concept of persistent object can be replicated by the schema mechanism.

1362	Bibliography		Do the Right Thing:Studies in Limited Rationality	20120924	"Like Mooki, the hero of Spike Lee's film ""Do the Right Thing,"" artificially intelligent systems have a hard time knowing what to do in all circumstances. Classical theories of perfect rationality prescribe the ""right thing"" for any occasion, but no finite agent can compute their prescriptions fast enough. In Do the Right Thing, the authors argue that a new theoretical foundation for artificial intelligence can be constructed in which rationality is a property of ""programs"" within a finite architecture, and their behavior over time in the task environment, rather than a property of individual decisions.Do the Right Thing suggests that the rich structure that seems to be exhibited by humans, and ought to be exhibited by AI systems, is a necessary result of the pressure for optimal behavior operating within a system of strictly limited resources. It provides an outline for the design of new intelligent systems and describes theoretical and practical tools for bringing about intelligent behavior in finite machines. The tools are applied to game planning and realtime problem solving, with surprising results.Stuart Russell is Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. This book builds on important philosophical and technical work by his coauthor, the late Eric Wefald."

1365	New early failure phenomenon in electrostatic discharge damaged giant magnetoresistive recording heads	Wallash, A.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	The magnetic behavior of partially electrostatic discharge (ESD) damaged giant magnetoresistive (GMR) heads during thermal and bias current stress is studied. Heads were ESD damaged to a level that would still pass quasistatic specifications and then monitored while at a higher temperature (100 ﾰC or 150 ﾰC) and bias current (5 to 6 mA) for up to 40 h. While controls showed no early changes, significant changes in amplitude, asymmetry, and Barkhausen jump were seen within the first hour of stressing in 10% of the partially ESD damaged heads. Heads that experienced pinned layer reversal or developed Barkhausen jumps were especially prone to large changes in magnetic response during stressing. It is concluded that some partially ESD damaged GMR heads can exhibit spontaneous and large degradation in amplitude and magnetic stability during high thermal and bias current stressing. ﾩ 2003 American Institute of Physics.

1366	Equivalence of Backpropagation and Contrastive Hebbian Learning in a Layered Network	Xie, X; Seung, H	Neural Computation	20140519	Backpropagation and contrastive Hebbian learning are two methods of training networks with hidden neurons. Backpropagation computes an error signal for the output neurons and spreads it over the hidden neurons. Contrastive Hebbian learning involves clamping the output neurons at desired values and letting the effect spread through feedback connections over the entire network. To investigate the relationship between these two forms of learning, we consider a special case in which they are identical: a multilayer perceptron with linear output units, to which weak feedback connections have been added. In this case, the change in network state caused by clamping the output neurons turns out to be the same as the error signal spread by backpropagation, except for a scalar prefactor. This suggests that the functionality of backpropagation can be realized alternatively by a Hebbian-type learning algorithm, which is suitable for implementation in biological networks.								
1367	New near-field and far-field attenuation models for free-space variable optical attenuators	Zhang, X.M.; Liu, A.Q.; Lu, C.	Lightwave Technology, Journal of	20040206	Novel closed-form attenuation models have been developed for free-space variable optical attenuators (VOAs)-one deals with the near-field condition when the two single-mode fibers are aligned very close to each other while the other deals with the far-field condition. In both models, the relationship between mirror (i.e., shutter) position and attenuation is represented by a constant term and another term in the form of an extended error function. The constant term determines the insertion loss, while the error function defines the shape of the attenuation curve. Compared with the conventional model that employs time-consuming numerical integrals, these two models show clearly the physical picture of the attenuation mechanism and provide closed-form expressions of attenuation versus mirror position. They are computationally efficient for attenuator design and optimization. Numerical calculation and experimental study have also been carried out to verify the attenuation models developed in this paper.	,Acoustic beams;Attenuation;Insertion loss;Lenses;Micromechanical devices;Mirrors;Optical attenuators;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber polarization;Optical receivers,Fraunhofer diffraction;Fresnel diffraction;micro-optics;micromechanical devices;mirrors;optical attenuators;optical communication equipment;optical design techniques;optical fibre communication;optical fibre couplers;optical fibre lossesVOAs;attenuation curve;attenuator design;extended error function;far-field attenuation models;fiber alignment;free-space variable optical attenuators;insertion loss;mirror position;near-field attenuation models;shutter;single-mode fibers

Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20030709	This work addresses the robust output feedback tracking problem for a biological wastewater treatment process in the presence of input constraints and limited knowledge on the process parameters. The considered process is an anaerobic up-flow fixed bed biological reactor within a semi-industrial scale pilot plant for the treatment of industrial wine distillery wastewater. A mathematical model describing the dynamic behavior of the biological process is considered and nonlinear control techniques are used to design a bounded output feedback control law. Local asymptotic stability and local set-point tracking of the resulting closed-loop system is proved when the dilution rate is selected as the manipulated variable and the output methane gas flow-rate as the measured and controlled variable. Finally, the implementation of the nonlinear output feedback control law is described and experimental results are reported. It is observed that the proposed controller yields set-point regulation, rejects disturbances and preserves stability despite uncertainty on the kinetic parameters.	,Biological control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Inductors;Mathematical model;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Output feedback;Plants (biology);Robustness;Wastewater treatment;Wine industry,asymptotic stability;closed loop systems;feedback;nonlinear control systems;tracking;water treatmentanaerobic fixed bed biological reactor;asymptotic stability;bounded output feedback control;closed-loop system;continuous biological reactors;industrial wine distillery wastewater;input constraints;nonlinear control;process control;set-point tracking;wastewater treatment plants

Energy Conversion, IEEE Transactions on	20030528	Condition monitoring leading to fault diagnosis and prediction of electrical machines and drives has recently become of importance. The topic has attracted researchers to work in during the past few years because of its great influence on the operational continuation of many industrial processes. Correct diagnosis and early detection of incipient faults result in fast unscheduled maintenance and short down time for the machine under consideration. It also avoids harmful, sometimes devastative, consequences and helps reduce financial loss. Reduction of the human experts involvement in the diagnosis process has gradually taken place upon the recent developments in the modern artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy and adaptive fuzzy systems, and expert systems are good candidates for the automation of the diagnostic procedures. This present work surveys the principles and criteria of the diagnosis process.

Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on	20030722	The probability of observing xt at time t, given past observations x1...xt-1 can be computed if the true generating distribution ? of the sequences x1x2x3... is known. If ? is unknown, but known to belong to a class &Mscr; one can base one's prediction on the Bayes mix ? defined as a weighted sum of distributions ? ? &Mscr;. Various convergence results of the mixture posterior ?t to the true posterior ?t are presented. In particular, a new (elementary) derivation of the convergence ?t/?t ? 1 is provided, which additionally gives the rate of convergence.

1375	Artificial intelligence: arrogance or ignorance?	Holmes, Neville	Computer	20031110	Whether the computing profession is ill-informed about natural intelligence or not, there are good arguments for dropping the term artificial intelligence as a name for the nifty programming field. The Oxford English Dictionary, second edition (www.oed.com), defines algorist as a descriptor for a nifty programmer, but deems the word obsolete. Here, then, we have a word ripe for reanimation. The derived term, algoristics, would make a highly suitable replacement for artificial intelligence, being more correct historically than the corrupt algorithmics. Placing this renamed field alongside statistics and logistics, as a branch of mathematics, would benefit the computing profession greatly. Given that algoristic techniques are highly mathematical and require a much greater degree of mathematical knowledge than ordinary programming, they should be taught and studied primarily by mathematicians.	,Agricultural machinery;Artificial intelligence;Books;Dictionaries;Digital control;Ethics;History;Machine intelligence;Machinery production industries;Shape,artificial intelligence;nomenclatureAI;algorist;artificial intelligence;nifty programming;terminology

1377	Semantic abstractions in the multimedia domain	Megalou, E.; Hadzilacos, T.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20030114	"Information searching by exactly matching content is traditionally a strong point of machine searching; this is not, however, how human memory works and is rarely satisfactory for advanced retrieval tasks in any domain-multimedia in particular, where the presentational aspects can be equally important to the semantic information content. A combined abstraction of the conceptual and presentational characteristics of multimedia applications, leading on the one hand to their conceptual structure (with classic semantics of the real-world modeled by entities, relationships, and attributes) and on the other to the presentational structure (including media type, logical structure, temporal synchronization, spatial (on the screen) ""synchronization"" and interactive behavior) is developed in this paper. Multimedia applications are construed as consisting of ""Presentational Units:"" elementary (a media object with play duration and screen position), and composite (recursive structures of PUs in the temporal, spatial, and logical dimensions). The fundamental concept introduced is that of Semantic Multimedia Abstractions (SMA): qualitative abstract descriptions of multimedia applications in terms of their conceptual and presentational properties at an adjustable level of abstraction. SMAs, which could be viewed as metadata, form an abstract space to be queried. A detailed study of possible abstractions (from multimedia applications to SMAs and SMA-to-SMA), a definition and query language for Semantic Multimedia Abstractions (SMA-L) and the corresponding SMA model (equivalent to extended OMT), as well as an implementation of a system capable of wrapping the presentational structure of XML-based documents complete this work, whose contribution lays in the classically fruitful boundary between AI, software engineering, and database research."	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Content based retrieval;Database languages;Humans;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Software engineering;Wrapping,content-based retrieval;data models;hypermedia markup languages;image retrieval;meta data;multimedia databases;query languagesSMA model;Semantic Multimedia Abstractions;XML-based documents;data model;information searching;metadata;multimedia database;query language;semantic abstractions;semantic information content;spatio-temporal retrieval;temporal synchronization

The growth mechanism, interfacial structure, and electrical properties have been investigated by various techniques. The ultrathin films show smaller roughness of ?0.3 nm, larger band gap of 6.47 eV, and good thermal stability. The growth follows a chemical dynamic control mechanism. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirms there exists no interfacial layer, or only thinner ones, between LAO and Si. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal that the thinner interfacial layer is compositionally graded LaﾖAlﾖSiﾖO silicate and Al element is deficient in the interfacial layer. The reliable value of equivalent oxide thickness around 1.2 nm of LAO/Si has been achieved. ﾩ 2003 American Institute of Physics.

1381	Reliable broadcasting in wormhole-routed hypercube-connected networks using local safety information	Dong Xiang; Ai Chen; Jie Wu	Reliability, IEEE Transactions on	20030715	This paper presents a method to cope with reliable broadcasting in faulty hypercubes using local safety information. A new definition, broadcast subcube, is introduced, with which various techniques are proposed to improve performance of the broadcast algorithm. Local safety information is well used in the fault-tolerant broadcast algorithm by considering only safety of the broadcast subcube. An unsafe hypercube can be split into a set of maximal safe subcubes. If these maximal safe subcubes meet certain requirements (listed in this paper), then broadcasting can still be done successfully and, in some cases, optimal broadcast is still possible. The sufficient condition for optimal broadcast of a message is presented in an unsafe hypercube. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms previous methods, in all cases.	,Broadcasting;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Hamming distance;Hypercubes;Intelligent networks;Microelectronics;Partitioning algorithms;Safety;Sufficient conditions,computer network reliability;data communication;hypercube networks;network routing;safetybroadcast algorithm;broadcast subcube;faulty hypercubes;local safety information;reliable broadcasting;unsafe hypercube;wormhole-routed hypercube-connected networks

1384	Use of modified Gaussian beams to optimize shaped reflectors	Schott, P.; Pascal, O.; Lemaitre, F.	Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters, IEEE	20050223	An efficient electromagnetic method for the optimization of shaped reflectors is presented. The repeated computation of scattering from a reflector surface at each iteration, using the conventional numerical techniques of either physical optics (PO) or aperture integration (AI), usually makes the iterative procedures very inefficient for the synthesis of large reflectors. An asymptotic Gaussian beam (GB) technique has been developed and applied successfully to the fast analysis of reflector antennas of various shapes (Cabbage, H.-T. et al., Proc. IEEE Ant. and Propag. Society URSI Symp., vol. 4, p.2336-9, 1999). This GB technique completely avoids numerical integration and thus makes the analysis very efficient. Our method uses the GB technique, coupled with a local description of the primary source and the reflector. The primary source radiation is expanded using a modified Gaussian beams basis. An antenna pattern calculation is demonstrated on a reflector that is described by local parameters in a novel way. By virtue of these local properties and the use of a steep step descent algorithm, a basic display of antenna pattern optimization is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.	,Apertures;Artificial intelligence;Electromagnetic scattering;Optical computing;Optical scattering;Optimization methods;Physical optics;Physics computing;Reflector antennas;Shape,antenna radiation patterns;directive antennas;iterative methods;optimisation;reflector antennas;satellite antennas;shaped beam antennasantenna pattern optimization;aperture integration;asymptotic Gaussian beam technique;contoured beam;iterative procedures;modified Gaussian beams;physical optics;primary source;satellite antennas;scattering;shaped reflector antennas;steep step descent algorithm

However, we have yet to develop a system that spans the full spectrum of intelligent behavior. For example, building a system that an make sensible decisions about unfamiliar situations in everyday, nonspecialist domains remains difficult. Nevertheless, it seems likely that applications like distributed blackboards will continue apace in specialist domains. This quiet revolution can make a significant contribution to our lives. Meanwhile, we can also expect progress toward the popular idea of AI manifested in human-like robots as we progress in simulating vision, language, common sense, and adaptability behaviors.	,Artificial intelligence;Computer displays;Humans;Law;Legal factors;Mathematical analysis;Projectiles;Rabbits;Spectrogram;Testing,artificial intelligence;blackboard architecture;multilayer perceptrons;robots;technological forecastingartificial intelligence;buckboard systems;human-like robots;intelligent behavior;multilayer perceptron;preconceptions							
1386	Nonlinear time-frequency distributions of spectrum energy operator in large vocabulary mandarin speaker independent speech recognition system	Ai-Dulaimy, Fadhil H. T.; Wang, Zuoying	Tsinghua Science and Technology	20120117	This work demonstrates the use of the nonlinear time-frequency distribution (NLTFD) of a discrete time energy operator (DTEO) based on amplitude demodulation modulation demodulation techniques as a feature in speech recognition. The duration distribution based hidden Markov module in a speaker independent large vocabulary mandarin speech recognition system was reconstructed from the feature vectors in the front-end detection stage. The goal was to improve the performance of the existing system by corrbining new features to the baseline ne feature vector. This paper also deals with errors associated with using a pre-emphasis filter in the front end processing of the present scheme, which causes an increase in the noise energy at high frequencies above 4 kHz and in some cases degrades the recognition accuracy. The experimental results show that eliminating the pre-emphasis filters from the pre-processing stage and using NLTFD with compensated DTEO combined with Mel frequency cepstrum components give a 21. 95% reduction in the relative error rate corrpared to the conventional technique with 25 candidates used in the test.

The nanobelts are growing along with [001] facets, and the nanosheets are stacked up by (011) facets. The Raman scattering spectrum of Ga2O3 nanostructures shows a 30 cm-1 redshift at high wave numbers in comparison with that of bulk Ga2O3 powder. The photoluminescence spectrum reveals that there exists a stable blue emission band centered at 460 nm, which is mainly attributed to the oxygen vacancies in the Ga2O3 nanostructures. ﾩ 2002 American Institute of Physics.

1392	Selectively Grouping Neurons in Recurrent Networks of Lateral Inhibition	Xie, X; Hahnloser, R; Seung, H	Neural Computation	20140519	Winner-take-all networks have been proposed to underlie many of the brain's fundamental computational abilities. However, notmuchisknown about how to extend the grouping of potential winners in these networks beyond single neuron or uniformly arranged groups of neurons. We show that competition between arbitrary groups of neurons can be realized by organizing lateral inhibition in linear threshold networks. Given a collection of potentially overlapping groups (with the exception of some degenerate cases), the lateral inhibition results in network dynamics such that any permitted set of neurons that can be coactivated by some input at a stable steady state is contained in one of the groups. The information about the input is preserved in this operation. The activity level of a neuron in a permitted set corresponds to its stimulus strength, amplified by some constant. Sets of neurons that are not part of a group cannot be coactivated by any input at a stable steady state. We analyze the storage capacity of such a network for random groupsﾗthe number of random groups the network can store as permitted sets without creating too many spurious ones. In this framework, we calculate the optimal sparsity of the groups (maximizing group entropy). We find that for dense inputs, the optimal sparsity is unphysiologically small. However, when the inputs and the groups are equally sparse, we derive a more plausible optimal sparsity. We believe our results are the first steps toward attractor theories in hybrid analog-digital networks.								
1393	AI automates substation control	Ayala S, M.; Botura, G.; Maldonado A, O.A.	Computer Applications in Power, IEEE	20020807	The control of a substation is a very complex task due to the great number of related problems and, therefore, the decision variables that can influence the substation performance. Under such circumstances, the use of learning control systems can be very useful. The difficulties associated with the application of artificial intelligence techniques include: selection of the magnitudes to be controlled; definition and implementation of the soft techniques; and elaboration of a programming tool to execute the control. The interest of the present work is to expose the obtained results and to present them for discussion. The objective is to show that it is possible to control the status of circuit breakers (CB) in a substation making use of a knowledge base that relates some of the operation magnitudes, mixing status variables with time variables and fuzzy sets. Even when all the magnitudes to be controlled cannot be included in the analysis (mostly due to the great number of measurements and status variables of the substation and, therefore, to the rules that would be required by the controller), it is possible to control the desired status while supervising some important magnitudes as the voltage, power factor, and harmonic distortion, as well as the present status	,Artificial intelligence;Automatic control;Circuit breakers;Control systems;Distortion measurement;Fuzzy sets;Harmonic analysis;Learning;Substations;Voltage control,artificial intelligence;circuit breakers;fuzzy control;harmonic distortion;knowledge based systems;learning systems;power factor;power system control;substations;voltage controlartificial intelligence techniques;circuit breaker status control;fuzzy sets;harmonic distortion;knowledge base;learning control systems;power factor control;programming tool;substation control automation;voltage control

1405	Adaptive early-detection ML-PDA estimator for LO targets with EO sensors	Chummun, M.R.; Bar-Shalom, Y.; Kirubarajan, T.	Aerospace and Electronic Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20020807	The batch maximum likelihood estimator, combined with the probabilistic data association algorithm (ML-PDA), has. been shown to be effective in acquiring low observable (LO)-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-nonmaneuvering targets in the presence of heavy clutter. The use of signal strength or amplitude information (AI) in the ML-PDA estimator facilitates the acquisition of weak targets. We present an adaptive algorithm, which uses the ML-PDA estimator with AI in a sliding-window fashion, to detect possibly maneuvering targets in heavy clutter using electro-optical (EO) sensors. The initial time and the length of the sliding window are adjusted adaptively according to the information content of the received measurements. A track validation scheme via hypothesis testing is developed to confirm the estimated track, that is, the presence of a target, in each window. The sliding-window ML-PDA approach, together with track validation, enables early track detection by rejecting noninformative scans, target reacquisition in case of temporary target disappearance, and the handling of targets with velocities evolving over time. We demonstrate the operation of the adaptive sliding-window ML-PDA estimator on a real scenario for tracking a fast-moving F1 Mirage fighter jet using an imaging sensor. The proposed algorithm is shown to detect the target, which is hidden in as many as 600 false alarms per scan, 10 frames earlier than the multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm. This ability to successfully process large amounts of data, with near real-time performance, under time-varying low SNR conditions makes the proposed estimator superior to other existing approaches	,Adaptive algorithm;Amplitude estimation;Artificial intelligence;Electrooptic devices;Electrooptic effects;Length measurement;Maximum likelihood detection;Maximum likelihood estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Target tracking,adaptive signal detection;clutter;least squares approximations;maximum likelihood detection;optical tracking;sensor fusion;target trackingMonte Carlo integration;Raleigh model;adaptive algorithm;amplitude information;batch maximum likelihood estimator;electro-optical sensors;fast-moving fighter jet;heavy clutter;hypothesis testing;least squares criterion;long wave infrared data;low observable targets;low signal-to-noise ratio;near real-time performance;negative log-likelihood function;nonmaneuvering targets;probabilistic data association algorithm;sliding-window;track validation scheme							
1406	The generation of binary and near-binary pseudorandom signals: an overview	Ai Hui Tan; Godfrey, K.R.	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20021210	Pseudorandom signals have been widely used for system identification. Maximum length binary (MLB) signals are the best known class of pseudorandom signals, because of their ease of generation using feedback shift registers, but it is less well known that there are several other classes of binary and near-binary signals with identical, or nearly identical properties. An overview of these classes of signals is given, and the design of a new MATLAB routine incorporating all these classes of signals is described. The importance of the choice of MLB signal to use in particular applications is illustrated with the identification of a Wiener system having a quadratic nonlinearity and a cubic nonlinearity. Using correlation analysis to estimate the linear system weighting function, errors due to the nonlinearities can be reduced if an appropriate choice is made of feedback connections and of data length used for the estimation.	,Autocorrelation;Feedback;Frequency domain analysis;MATLAB;Power engineering and energy;Shift registers;Signal design;Signal generators;Signal processing;System identification,binary sequences;circuit feedback;correlation methods;electronic engineering computing;identification;nonlinear systems;perturbation techniques;shift registers;stochastic processesMATLAB routines;Wiener system;binary pseudorandom signals;correlation analysis;cubic nonlinearity;estimation data length;feedback connections;feedback shift registers;linear system weighting function analysis;maximum length binary signals;near-binary pseudorandom signal generation;nonlinearity error reduction;perturbation signals;pseudorandom signal class overview;quadratic nonlinearity;system identification

The topology combines forward and flyback circuits with a post regulator. To maintain a high power factor, the flyback circuit delivers the major output power, while the output voltage is controlled by the post regulator with fast response to suppress line-frequency ripple without the use of a high voltage bulk capacitor or current sensor on the primary side.

1412	Preface	Hong, Se June; Birman, Alex; Ritsko, John J.	IBM Systems Journal	20100406	The practical side of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) aims to imbue smartness into computers and applications so that people may use the computers as if the machines are able savants. However, computers and computer systems, connected through the Internet, have evolved into giant and complex man-made machinery serving virtually anyone, anywhere and anytime. Although this Internet-connected machinery serves millions of people daily, there are many more potential users unable to use the technology because of nonintuitive and hard-to-use interfaces, limited and inflexible capabilities, delays, and outages. As our dependence on computers increases, there is an increasing need for these computers to be made smart, and the enabling technologies will depend more and more on advances in AI.								
1413	Review of the basic insulation level for 400 kV oil-filled cable systems under lightning events	Probert, S.A.; Song, Y. -H; Basak, P.K.; Ferguson, C.P.	Generation, Transmission and Distribution, IEE Proceedings-	20021210	The lightning impulse duty for 400 kV underground power cables using ATP is investigated and the recommended design level based on a probabilistic analysis is reassessed. A comprehensive study of the transient overvoltages experienced by cables within the UK National Grid's transmission system has been performed. The paper investigates the effects of transient overvoltages due to lightning. To determine the peak voltages that a cable would experience, direct lightning strikes and backflashovers onto the overhead-line phase conductor were simulated both near a cable termination and at air-insulated substation (AIS) and gas-insulated substation (GIS) zones. A second paper will present the investigation into transient overvoltages due to switching, faults and other temporary overvoltages (TOV). A probabilistic approach to argue for a reduction of the basic insulation level (BIL) for 400 kV cables to a value of 1050 kVp is used.	insulating oils;lightning protection;overvoltage;overvoltage protection;power cable insulation;power system analysis computing;power system protection;substations;underground cables1050 kV;400 kV;ATP;UK;air-insulated substation;backflashovers;basic insulation level;cable termination;computer simulation;direct lightning strikes;gas-insulated substation;lightning impulse duty;overhead-line phase conductor;peak voltages;probabilistic analysis;recommended design level;transient overvoltages;underground oil-filled power cables

1415	Discretized learning automata solutions to the capacity assignment problem for prioritized networks	Oommen, B.J.; Roberts, T.D.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20021210	We present a discretized learning automaton (LA) solution to the capacity assignment (CA) problem which focuses on finding the best possible set of capacities for the links that satisfy the traffic requirements in a prioritized network while minimizing the cost. Most approaches consider a single class of packets flowing through the network, but in reality, different classes of packets with different average packet lengths and different priorities are transmitted over the networks. This generalized model is the focus of this paper. Although the problem is inherently NP-hard, a few approximate solutions have been proposed in the literature. Marayuma and Tang (1977) proposed a single algorithm composed of several elementary heuristic procedures. Other solutions tackle the problem by using modern-day artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms (GAs). In 2000, we introduced a new method, superior to these, that uses continuous LA. In this paper, we present a discretized LA solution to the problem. This solution uses a meta-action philosophy new to the field of LA, and is probably the best available solution to this extremely complex problem.	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Costs;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Learning automata;Local area networks;Simulated annealing;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,computer networks;learning automata;telecommunication trafficaverage packet lengths;capacity assignment problem;discretized learning automata solutions;meta-action philosophy;packets;priorities;prioritized networks;traffic requirements

Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on	20030219	The nature of disruptive and sustaining technologies is sufficiently different to require different activities for the commercialization of these technology categories. Few theorists have developed conceptual schemes about the different methods of commercializing these technologies. The authors take the first steps in investigating these differences by contrasting firms that commercialize disruptive technologies with those that commercialize sustaining technologies. They reveal major differences and analyze these in terms of four major commercialization components: product realization, revenue generation, research support, and market potential. Several hypotheses regarding size of the firm, its financial risk profile, and its R&D strategy are utilized.	,Business;Commercialization;Decision making;Laboratories;Mechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Research and development;Technological innovation;Technology management;Testing,product development;research and development management;technology managementR&D management;R&D strategy;conceptual schemes;disruptive sustaining technologies commercialization;market potential;product realization;research support;revenue generation							
1422	Thermal conductivity enhancement of suspensions containing nanosized alumina particles	Xie, Huaqing; Wang, Jinchang; Xi, Tonggeng; Liu, Yan; Ai, Fei; Wu, Qingren	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Various suspensions containing Al2O3 nanoparticles with specific surface areas in a range of 5ﾖ124 m2 g-1 have been prepared and their thermal conductivities have been investigated using a transient hot-wire method. Nanoparticle suspensions, containing a small amount of Al2O3, have substantially higher thermal conductivity than the base fluid, with the enhancement increasing with the volume fraction of Al2O3. The enhanced thermal conductivity increases with an increase in the difference between the pH value of aqueous suspension and the isoelectric point of Al2O3 particle. For the suspensions using the same base fluid, the thermal conductivity enhancements are highly dependent on specific surface area (SSA) of nanoparticle, with an optimal SSA for the highest thermal conductivity. For the suspensions containing the same nanoparticles, the enhanced thermal conductivity ratio is reduced with the increasing thermal conductivity of the base fluid. The crystalline phase of the nanoparticles appears to have no obvious effect on the thermal conductivity of the suspensions. Comparison between the experiments and the theoretical model shows that the measured thermal conductivity is much higher than the values calculated using theoretical correlation, indicating new heat transport mechanisms included in nanoparticle suspensions. ﾩ 2002 American Institute of Physics.	alumina;nanostructured materials;suspensions;thermal conductivity6146+w;6580+n;6660+a;8270Kj,							
1423	Identification of Wiener-Hammerstein models using linear interpolation in the frequency domain (LIFRED)	Ai Hui Tan; Godfrey, K.	Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on	20020807	A new method to identify the linear subsystems of a Wiener-Hammerstein model through the measurement of the second-order Volterra kernel is proposed. This technique makes use of the symmetry properties of the Volterra kernel and assumes that the frequency response gain and phase between estimated points can be reasonably well approximated by a straight line. The signal applied for the identification is a multisine with properties of no interharmonic distortion. Several advantages of the proposed method over existing ones are discussed, and two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the technique. The method is also shown to be robust to noise and distortion in the input signal	,Distortion;Frequency domain analysis;Frequency estimation;Frequency measurement;Interpolation;Kernel;Linear systems;Noise robustness;Nonlinear systems;Signal processing,frequency response;frequency-domain analysis;identification;interpolation;linear systems;nonlinear systems;transfer functionsWiener-Hammerstein model;frequency domain identification;frequency response gain;linear interpolation;linear subsystems;second-order Volterra kernel

1425	Parallel operation of capacity-limited three-phase four-wire active power filters	Chiang, S.J.; Ai, W.J.; Lin, F.-J.	Electric Power Applications, IEE Proceedings -	20021210	Three-phase four-wire active power filters (APFs) are presented that can be paralleled to enlarge the system capacity and reliability. The APF employs the PWM four-leg voltage-source inverter. A decoupling control approach for the leg connected to the neutral line is proposed such that the switching of all legs has no interaction. Functions of the proposed APF include compensation of reactive power, harmonic current, unbalanced power and zero-sequence current of the load. The objective is to achieve unity power factor, balanced line current and zero neutral-line current. Compensation of all components is capacity-limited, co-operating with the cascaded load current sensing scheme. Multiple APFs can be paralleled to share the load power without requiring any control interconnection. In addition to providing the theoretic bases and detailed design of the APFs, two 6 kVA APFs are implemented.

Can John Searle's Chinese room argument [12]ﾗoriginally intended by him to show that the thesis he dubs ﾓstrong AIﾔ is falseﾗbe deployed against strong ALife? We have often encountered the suggestion that it can be (even in print; see Harnad [8]). We do our best to transfer the argument from the domain of AI to that of ALife. We do so in order to show once and for all that the Chinese room argument proves nothing about ALife. There may indeed be powerful philosophical objections to the thesis of strong ALife, but the Chinese room argument is not among them.

In this paper, we make this distinction by modeling measurement errors instead.

1455	An artificial intelligent algorithm for tumor detection in screening mammogram	Lei Zhen; Chan, A.K.	Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on	20020807	Cancerous tumor mass is one of the major types of breast cancer. When cancerous masses are embedded in and camouflaged by varying densities of parenchymal tissue structures, they are very difficult to be visually detected on mammograms. This paper presents an algorithm that combines several artificial intelligent techniques with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for detection of masses in mammograms. The AI techniques include fractal dimension analysis, multiresolution Markov random field, dogs-and-rabbits algorithm, and others. The fractal dimension analysis serves as a preprocessor to determine the approximate locations of the regions suspicious for cancer in the mammogram. The dogs-and-rabbits clustering algorithm is used to initiate the segmentation at the LL subband of a three-level DWT decomposition of the mammogram. A tree-type classification strategy is applied at the end to determine whether a given region is suspicious for cancer. The authors have verified the algorithm with 322 mammograms in the Mammographic Image Analysis Society Database. The verification results show that the proposed algorithm has a sensitivity of 97.3% and the number of false positives per image is 3.92.	,Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Breast cancer;Breast neoplasms;Cancer detection;Clustering algorithms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Fractals;Markov random fields;Tumors,Markov processes;discrete wavelet transforms;fractals;image classification;image segmentation;mammography;medical image processing;tumoursartificial intelligent algorithm;breast cancer;cancerous tumor mass;discrete wavelet transform;dogs-and-rabbits algorithm;false positives;fractal dimension analysis;medical diagnostic imaging;multiresolution Markov random field;parenchymal tissue structures;screening mammogram;tree-type classification strategy;tumor detectionAlgorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Neoplasms;Databases, Factual;Decision Support Techniques;Female;Fractals;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Mammography;Markov Chains;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted

1457	Estimation of mechanical properties from gated SPECT and cine MRI data using a finite-element mechanical model of the left ventricle	Feng, B.; Veress, A.I.; Sitek, A.; Gullberg, G.T.; Roy, D.G.	Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions on	20020807	A significant challenge in diagnosing cardiac disease is determining the viability of myocardial tissue when evaluating the prognosis of vascular bypass surgery. A finite-element mechanical model of the left ventricular myocardium was developed to evaluate mechanical properties of the myocardium, which is an important indicator of viable myocardial tissue and of several aspects of congestive heart failure. The model of the heart muscle mechanics was derived from the passive and active behavior of skeletal muscle, which is considered to be a quasi-incompressible transversely isotropic hyperelastic material of a specified helical fiber structure configuration. Contraction of the myocardium was replicated by simulating active contractions along the helical fibers, then solving (quasi-statically) for the associated boundary valued problem at a sequence of time steps between end-diastole and end-systole of the cardiac cycle. At each time step, the finite-element software package ABAQUS was used to determine the deformation of the left ventricle, which was loaded by intraventricular pressure. An ellipsoidal and a cylindrical model of the left ventricle were developed under both passive loading and active contraction. Parameters that describe the material properties of the myocardium were estimated for the cylindrical model by fitting the radial motion described by the model to gated SPECT and cine MRI data. The authors found that the estimation was sensitive to the measurement of the motion. Results from the finite-clement analysis were compared to those from a purely mathematical description of the cylindrical model	,Biological materials;Cardiac disease;Finite element methods;Heart;Magnetic resonance imaging;Mechanical factors;Motion estimation;Muscles;Myocardium;Surgery,biomechanics;biomedical MRI;cardiology;finite element analysis;muscle;physiological models;single photon emission computed tomographycine MRI data;finite-element mechanical model;gated SPECT;left ventricle;magnetic resonance imaging;mechanical properties estimation;medical diagnostic imaging;nuclear medicine

Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20050404	KISS Institute's Botball program is a national program, designed for middle and high school students, that uses the activities of robot building and programming to engage students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Botball puts robotics equipment into schools, then trains students and teachers in that equipment's use. The program is organized into spring regional tournaments and a national Botball tournament held at the Annual National Conference on Artificial Intelligence. This program is playing an important role in creating and inspiring the next generation of AI and robotics technologists, many of whom might very well be the engineers and computer scientists who design and build sophisticated, highly autonomous rovers and other space platforms for future NASA missions of exploration.

Applied Physics Letters	20090618	We report on a theoretical investigation of power spectrum dynamics in negative-effective-mass (NEM) p+pp+ oscillators under the influence of terahertz (THz) electromagnetic radiation. Possible types of transport states (periodic or chaotic) and transitions between them are examined with the intensity and frequency of the radiation as controlling parameters. When the driving frequency is fixed to the self-oscillating frequency times the inverse Golden ratio, the resulting power spectrum pattern displays a very complex mosaic scenario with a self-similar emergence of high-order mixing frequencies. ﾩ 2001 American Institute of Physics.	bifurcation;chaos;effective mass;nonlinear dynamical systems;submillimetre wave diodes;submillimetre wave oscillators0545Xt;0757Hm;8430Ng;8530Kk,							
1460	Asymmetry in search	Kaindl, H.; Kainz, G.; Radda, K.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020807	Most of the work on search in artificial intelligence (AI) deals with one search direction only-mostly forward search-although it is known that a structural asymmetry of the search graph causes differences in the efficiency of searching in the forward or the backward direction, respectively. In the case of symmetrical graph structure, however, current theory would not predict such differences in efficiency. In several classes of job sequencing problems, we observed a phenomenon of asymmetry in search that relates to the distribution of the are costs in the search graph. This phenomenon can be utilized for improving the search efficiency by a new algorithm that automatically selects the search direction. We demonstrate fur a class of job sequencing problems that, through the utilization of this phenomenon, much more difficult problems can be solved-according to our best knowledge-than by the best published approach, and on the same problems, the running time is much reduced. As a consequence, we propose to check given problems for asymmetrical distribution of are costs that may cause asymmetry in search	,Artificial intelligence;Cities and towns;Concrete;Cost function,artificial intelligence;graph theory;search problems;symmetryartificial intelligence;asymmetry;job sequencing problems;running time;search;search graph;structural asymmetry;symmetrical graph structure

Will intelligent agents be able to understand and mimic human emotions? Will computer programs become more sensitive to their users' moods? These are a few of the questions, some serious, some not, that AI researchers are confronting as they seek to determine the place of emotions in their field. Researchers are studying the role of emotions in AI from a variety of viewpoints: to develop agents and robots that interact more gracefully with humans, to develop systems that use the analog of emotions to aid their own reasoning, or to create agents or robots that more closely model human emotional interactions and learning.	,Artificial intelligence;Computer displays;Face detection;Facial animation;Human robot interaction;Intelligent agent;Intelligent robots;Intelligent systems;Mobile robots;Wearable computers,artificial intelligence;human factors;interactive systems;robots;user modellingAI researchers;artificial intelligences;human emotional interactions;human emotions;human machine interactive systems;intelligent agents;learning;reasoning;robots;user moods

The aging behavior at room temperature of these imprinted SBT capacitors was observed. The voltage shifts of imprinted PﾖV hysteresis loops increased with the increase of aging time, which indicated the strengthening of the internal bias created by the thermal treatment. With the strengthening of the internal bias, asymmetry of data loss was observed to increase with increasing aging time. The mechanism of the internal bias strengthening, the resultant asymmetric data loss and possible function failure due to this aging behavior were briefly discussed. ﾩ 2001 American Institute of Physics.	ageing;bismuth compounds;dielectric hysteresis;ferroelectric capacitors;ferroelectric ceramics;ferroelectric thin films;platinum;strontium compounds;thin film capacitors7755+f;7780Dj;7784Dy;8432Tt;8550-n,

1467	A programmable continuous-time floating-gate Fourier processor	Kucic, M.; Ai Chen Low; Hasler, P.; Neff, J.	Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on	20020807	We present a programmable continuous-time floating-gate Fourier processor that decomposes the incoming signal into frequency bands by analog bandpass filters, multiplies each channel by a nonvolatile weight, and then recombines the frequency channels. A digital signal processor would take a similar approach of computing a fast Fourier transform (FFT), multiplying the frequency components by a weight and then computing an inverse PFT. We decompose the frequency bands of the incoming signal using the transistor-only version of the autozeroing floating-gate amplifier (AFGA), also termed the capacitively coupled current conveyer (C4). Each band decomposition is then fed through a floating-gate multiplier to perform the band weighting. Finally, the multiplier outputs are summed using Kirchoff current law to give a band-weighted output of the original signal. We examine many options to reduce second-order harmonic problems inherent in the single-sided C4. We present a method for programming arrays of floating-gate devices that are used in the weighting of the bands. All of these pieces fit together to form an elegant and systematic Fourier processor	,Band pass filters;Broadcasting;Circuits;Digital signal processing;Digital signal processing chips;Fast Fourier transforms;Frequency;Nonvolatile memory;Signal processing;Voltage,analogue processing circuits;band-pass filters;continuous time filters;current conveyors;fast Fourier transforms;programmable circuitsKirchoff current law;analog bandpass filters;autozeroing floating-gate amplifier;band decomposition;band weighting;band-weighted output;capacitively coupled current conveyer;frequency bands;incoming signal decomposition;multiplier outputs;nonvolatile weight;programmable continuous-time floating-gate Fourier processor;second-order harmonic problems;systematic Fourier processor							
1468	Challenges for intelligent systems in biology	Altman, R.B.	Intelligent Systems, IEEE	20050404	Biological processes have produced the ultimate intelligent system (humans), and now we are trying to understand biology (and ourselves) by building intelligent systems. Intelligent systems research in biology strives to understand how living systems perform difficult tasks routinely (ranging from molecular phenomena such as protein-folding to organism-level phenomena such as cognition). The definition of intelligent systems in biology can lead to hours of debate. Some say that all high-performance systems that do something difficult with (or to) biological data should be considered intelligent systems. Others insist that the term intelligent system should be reserved for systems using the methods typically associated with modem AI.	,Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;DNA;Genomics;Intelligent systems;Organisms;Proteins;RNA;Sequences;Systems biology,biology computing;knowledge based systemsAI;biology;high-performance systems;intelligent systems

Possible error sources and typical methods of data analysis are addressed. The intent is to provide those involved in centrifuge testing with a detailed understanding of the various factors affecting the accuracy of measurement, both those associated with the centrifuge and those in the data collection process. Model equations are discussed, both for the centrifuge and for a typical linear accelerometer, each with the complexity needed to accommodate the various identified characteristics and error sources in each. An iterative matrix equation solution is presented for deriving the various model equation coefficients for the accelerometer under test from the centrifuge test data.

1470	Generality-based conceptual clustering with probabilistic concepts	Talavera, L.; Bejar, J.	Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on	20020807	Statistical research in clustering has almost universally focused on data sets described by continuous features and its methods are difficult to apply to tasks involving symbolic features. In addition, these methods are seldom concerned with helping the user in interpreting the results obtained. Machine learning researchers have developed conceptual clustering methods aimed at solving these problems. Following a long term tradition in AI, early conceptual clustering implementations employed logic as the mechanism of concept representation. However, logical representations have been criticized for constraining the resulting cluster structures to be described by necessary and sufficient conditions. An alternative are probabilistic concepts which associate a probability or weight with each property of the concept definition. In this paper, we propose a symbolic hierarchical clustering model that makes use of probabilistic representations and extends the traditional ideas of specificity-generality typically found in machine learning. We propose a parameterized measure that allows users to specify both the number of levels and the degree of generality of each level. By providing some feedback to the user about the balance of the generality of the concepts created at each level and given the intuitive behavior of the user parameter, the system improves user interaction in the clustering process	,Artificial intelligence;Clustering methods;Data analysis;Data mining;Feedback;Logic;Machine learning;Sufficient conditions;Tree data structures;Unsupervised learning,pattern clustering;probabilityAI;continuous features;data sets;feedback;generality-based conceptual clustering;logical representations;machine learning;necessary and sufficient conditions;probabilistic concepts;probabilistic representations;statistical research;symbolic features;symbolic hierarchical clustering model;user interaction

1472	An AI tool for supervising substations	Ayala, M.S.; Botura, G.J.; Maldonado, O.A.	Potentials, IEEE	20020807	Electric substations are facilities in charge of transform the voltage into safe and effective energy for the final consumers. This operation has to be carried out with enough quality assurance and without damaging the equipment. The associated cost to ensure this quality and security is high. Automatic mechanisms are used, however, they mostly operate under an individual's control and use the protection logic related with the equipment itself. They do not consider the state of the whole substation at a given moment. It is possible to control the state of circuit breakers (CB) in a substation using a knowledge base even when all the magnitudes to be controlled cannot be included in the analysis. It will be shown that it is possible to control the desired state while supervising some important magnitudes such as the voltage, power factor and harmonic distortion as well as the present state. At the same time, the programming tool developed for this purpose is discussed	,Artificial intelligence;Automatic control;Automatic logic units;Circuit breakers;Costs;Quality assurance;Reactive power;Security;Substation protection;Voltage control,artificial intelligence;circuit breakers;power system control;substationscircuit breakers;energy conservation;harmonic distortion;knowledge base;power factor;power system automation;programming tool;quality assurance;substations

Although the hysteresis loops of these films had an unacceptable degradation under such a H2-containing reducing atmosphere, no obvious polarization fatigue with electric field cycling could be observed. However, an increase of P*r was observed over the initial period of the fatigue test. It could be viewed as a competition between the increase of P*r due to the leakage current and the decrease of P*r due to switching polarization. H2 played an important role in the increasing in the leakage current of SBT thin films, forming more weak pinning centers of domain walls, and degradation in the fatigue characteristics. ﾩ 2001 American Institute of Physics.

1482	Low complexity coded modulation with codes over Zm	Ahd, Abdussalam Ibn; Tanabe, Hidehiko; Umeda, Hiroyuki	Communications and Networks, Journal of	20130912	Decoding complexity is an important criterion for selecting good modulation codes for the Gaussian channels. In iterative decoding algorithm, lower complexity trellis is used to decode higher complexity trellis and syndrome computation is performed to iteratively search the actual codewords. In this paper, the iterative decoding is applied to our proposed Ai-ary phase-shift keying (M-PSK) codes over the ring structure ZM, the ring of integers modulo M, (where M = 4), for code length n ? 10. The proposed code Cs offers good squared Euclidean distance d2e with high decoding complexity. Therefore, to apply iterative decoding, the reduced complexity trellis parent code Cp has been investigated and found. The parent code Cp presents about one-fourth of Viterbi decoding complexity compared to Cs, where Cs ? Cp. Depending upon the number of iterations and trellis complexity of the parent codes, there is little performance degradation. Computer simulation of the subcodes Cs, using the trellises of the parent codes Cp, provides almost the same error performance compared to conventional maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding when iteration reaches more than 20. The proposed codes present substantial reduction of computational complexity compared to the ML soft decision decoding when the decoding is performed by iterative decoding using reduced trellis parent codes.

1485	Generating test-cases from an object-oriented model with an artifical-intelligence planning system	von Mayrhauser, A.; France, R.; Scheetz, M.; Dahlman, E.	Reliability, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Black-box test-generation requires a model of the system under test to describe what is to be tested. Testing criteria and test objectives define how it is to be tested. This paper describes an approach to black-box test-generation in which an AI (artificial intelligence) planner is used to generate test cases from test objectives derived from UML (Unified Modeling Language) Class Diagrams. The UML Class Diagrams are conceptual models of the systems under test. They differ from traditional design and requirements models in that they include information pertinent to test case generation. From these models, test objectives and a domain theory are: obtained, transformed to planner representations, and input to the planner. The planner uses the problem description to generate a test suite that satisfies the UML-derived test objectives. This paper describes the application of the testing approach to an industrial problem	,Artificial intelligence;Automatic testing;Computer architecture;Computer science;Libraries;Object oriented modeling;Software testing;Storage automation;System testing;Unified modeling language,artificial intelligence;object-oriented methods;program testing;software reliabilityUML Class Diagrams;Unified Modeling Language;artifical-intelligence planning system;artificial intelligence;black-box test-generation;object-oriented model;software reliability;software testing;test cases generation

1488	Automated software module reconfiguration through the use of artificial intelligence planning techniques	Chien, S.; Fisher, F.; Estlin, T.	Software, IEE Proceedings -	20020806	One important approach to enhancing software re-use is through the creation of large-scale software libraries. By modularising functionality, many complex specialised applications can be built up from smaller reusable general-purpose libraries. Consequently, many large software libraries have been formed for applications such as image processing and data analysis. However, knowing the requirements and formats of each of these routines requires considerable expertise thus limiting the usage of these libraries to experts. An approach is described to enable novices to use complex software libraries. In this approach, the interactions between, and requirements of, the software modules are represented in a declarative language based on artificial intelligence (AI) planning techniques. The user is then able to specify their goals in terms of this language-designating what they want accomplished instead of how to do it. The AI planning system then uses this model of the available subroutines to compose a domain specific script to fulfil the user request. Three such systems developed by the Artificial Intelligence Group of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and described. The multimission VICAR planner (MVP) was deployed in 1994 and used to support image processing for science product generation for the Galileo mission. MVP reduced the time for filling certain classes of requests from 4 h to 15 min. The automated SAR image processing system (ASIP) was deployed in 1996 to the Department of Geology at Arizona State University to support aeolian science analysis of synthetic aperture radar images. ASIP reduces the number of manual inputs in science product generation tenfold. Finally, the DPLAN system reconfigures software modules that control complex antenna hardware in configuring antennas to support a wide range of tracks for NASA's Deep Space Network of communications and radio science antennas	configuration management;deductive databases;knowledge based systems;planning (artificial intelligence);software librariesASIP;DPLAN system;Deep Space Network;Galileo mission;aeolian science analysis;artificial intelligence planning techniques;automated SAR image processing system;automated software module reconfiguration;complex antenna hardware;data analysis;declarative language;domain specific script;image processing;large-scale software libraries;multimission VICAR planner;radio science antennas;science product generation;software modules;software re-use;synthetic aperture radar images;user request

Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	An intense blue-violet band, centered at 3.0 eV, has been observed besides the red-orange band of the photoluminescence (PL) from the chemically modified porous silicon (PS) samples. The PS samples were formed on 30ﾖ50 ? cm p-type (100) Si wafers by anodic etching at large current densities and then treated with 5-cyano-1-pentynes in toluene solution at 110ﾖ120 ﾰC. The intensities of the blue-violet lights increase with the increasing of the etching current densities, while the peak energies are hardly changed. The Fourier transform infrared spectra of the modified samples show that the alkyls have been bonded to the surfaces of the nanometer crystallite silicon particles. The decays of the blue-violet emission with a lifetime about 0.5 ?s are different from the nanosecond lifetimes of the blue emissions in the oxidized PS samples reported before, and the 20 ?s lifetimes of the concomitant orange PL bands. A carbon-compounds-related luminescence center has been proposed as the origin of this blue-violet PL band. ﾩ 2000 American Institute of Physics.

1492	Topographic and Temporal Indices of Vowel Spectral Envelope Extraction in the Human Auditory Cortex	Diesch, E; Luce, T	Cognitive Neuroscience, Journal of	20140519	The audirory-evoked neuromagnetic field elicited by single vowel formants and two-formant vowels was recorded under active listening conditions using a 37-channel magnetometer. There were three single formants with formant with a formant frequency of 200, 400, and 800 Hz, another single fromant with a fromant frequency of 2600 Hz, and three vowels that were constructed by linear superimposition of the high-onto one of the low-frequency formants. P50m and N100m latency values were inversely correlated with the formant frequency of single location was obtained along the postero-anterior axiz, which is orthogonal to the well-established latero-medial tonotopic gradient. Regardless of whether single formants or first formants of vowels were considered N100m sources were more anterior and sustained field sources wre more posterior for higher-frequency than for lower-frequency formants. The velocity of the apparent posterior-to-anterior movement across cortical sorface of N100m sources first reported by Rogers et al. [Rogers, R.L., Papanicolaou, A.C., Baumann, S.B., Saydjari,C., & Eisenberg, H.M. (1990). Neuromagnetic evidence of a dynamic excitation pattern generating the N100 auditory response. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophy-siology,77,237-240] decreased as a function of latency. The amount of deceleration was positively correlated with formant frequency. responses to the vowels were superadditive, indicating that the processes elicited by the constituents of composite stumuli interact at one or more stages of the afferent auditory pathway. Such interaction may account for the absence of a lateral-to-medial tonotopic mapping of first formant frequency. The source topography found may reflect activity in auditory fields adjacent to AI with the strenght of the contribution varying with formant frequency. Altematively, it may reflect sharpness-of-tuning and inhbitory response-area asymmetry gradients along isofrequency stripes within AI. Either alternat- ve may be interpreted in terms of a sprctral blurring mechanism that abstracts spectral envelope information form the details of spectral composition, an important step towards the formation of invariant phonetic percepts.								
1493	Agent research and development in Europe	Sierra, C.; Wooldridge, M.; Sadeh, N.	Internet Computing, IEEE	20020806	European Community programs have been supporting agent-related projects for 15 years, initially on a relatively small scale but more recently through broader collaborative initiatives. One distinguishing feature of European programs is their emphasis on coordination and the support of value-adding activities that exceed the scope of specific projects. Another is the holistic approach, which ensures that technology isn't developed in a vacuum and that research is generally anchored in practical application contexts. The various agent projects are coordinated through initiatives such as the AgentLink network of excellence for agent-based computing. Three current projects funded by the European Commission suggest the breadth of agent-related issues: NIMIS, CASABA, and Mascada. The Networked Interactive Media in Schools (NIMIS) project aims to support young pupils in developing reading skills, notions of narrativity, and the ability to take a second- or third-person perspective across a range of situations. The Competitive Agents for Secure Business Applications (CASBA) project is intended to improve existing e-commerce services and develop new services to create a flexible electronic marketplace.

1495	Investigations into Performance of Minimally Invasive Telesurgery with Feedback Time Delays	Ottensmeyer, M; Hu, J; Thompson, J; Ren, J; Sheridan, T	Presence	20140519	This paper describes the testbed telesurgery system that was developed in MIT's Human Machine Systems Laboratory. This system was used to investigate the effects of communication time delays on controller stability and on the performance of surgical tasks. The system includes a bilateral force-reflecting teleoperator system, interchangeable surgical tools, audio and video communication between the master and slave sites, and methods to generate time delays between the sites. To compensate for the time delays, various control schemes were investigated, leading to the development and selection of fuzzy sliding control (FSC). With a stable teleoperator system, experiments in performing a variety of surgical exercises were conducted. These looked at the performance of a team of a telesurgeon and local assistant given a number of different time-delay scenarios, including synchronous and asynchronous force and audio/video feedback. The results of the research project include the development of the novel FSC algorithm, data on how time delays degrade performance of surgical tasks, and recommendations on how telesurgery should be performed to accommodate telecommunication time delays.								
1496	A laboratory course in behavior-based robotics	Horswill, I.	Intelligent Systems and their Applications, IEEE	20020806	Robotics has received a great deal of attention as a vehicle for motivating students to learn artificial intelligence, computer science, and even general science and engineering. Many courses involve the construction and programming of simple robots. Although these courses are excellent vehicles for teaching general engineering concepts, especially electrical and mechanical engineering, they tend to be dominated by hardware concerns. They cannot address what AI researchers think are the core concerns in designing autonomous robots-representation, planning, sensor fusion, and so on. This is because the robots lack the sensor suites needed to make these problems practical. At Northwestern University, we have taught a laboratory course that uses research-grade mobile robots to explore concepts of autonomy, such as sensor interpretation, planning, and action selection. The course uses low-cost, state-of-the-art hardware that provides not only sonar and odometric sensing but also several real-time vision systems.

1499	Advances in nuclear emission PET and SPECT imaging	Garcia, E.V.; Faber, T.L.; Galt, J.R.; Cooke, C.D.; Folks, R.D.	Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, IEEE	20020806	Improvements in technology and methods have resulted in a field that is ready to unlock the body's secrets. The advancements reviewed in this article are remarkable. Just ten years ago, SPECT myocardial tomograms exhibited a spatial resolution of close to 2 cm and PET scanners were prohibitively expensive. The instrumentation reviewed can image down to a 1.8 mm spatial resolution, and high-performance PET scanners and PET/SPECT cameras are being routinely sold for one-third the cost of the high-end PET scanners of ten years ago. These gains, coupled with the relative ease of developing positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals, opens a new chapter in physiologic imaging. Add to this that these modalities are inherently digital, facilitating their progress in totally automatic analysis; multidimensional, multimodality display; and computer-assisted image interpretation by the use of AI techniques.

1501	Causality levels in SCHEMA: a knowledge edition interface	Herrero, J.C.; Mira, J.	Software, IEE Proceedings -	20020806	In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to develop the same way as any other engineering discipline, it is necessary to have a methodology which starts from a definite set of specifications providing a detailed description of the process to achieve the corresponding implementation. In fact, those specifications are knowledge that the final implementation must display. Thereafter, a suitable verification and validation process must assess compliance with specifications, that are knowledge in this case. This is the way to ensure no disagreement between analysis and synthesis. However, this is not what happens in the current state of the art. Based on a study of causality in the whole computational process, and taking into account the environment where computation takes place, the knowledge disagreement between analysis and synthesis results is discussed. There is knowledge attributed to the implementations that is neither modelled nor implemented computers are usually assisted by human beings who understand the computer outputs and provide the computer inputs interpreting the whole computational process. Examples are illustrated by means of SCHEMA, a knowledge edition interface, and the consideration of causality providing the key that opens the way for computers to really hold knowledge without any human assistance or misinterpretation is discussed	knowledge acquisition;knowledge verificationSCHEMA;artificial intelligence;causality levels;computational process;computer inputs;computer outputs;engineering discipline;knowledge disagreement;knowledge edition interface;specifications;validation process;verification

1505	Integrating robotics research with undergraduate education	Maxwell, Bruce A.; Meeden, L.A.	Intelligent Systems and their Applications, IEEE	20020806	Swarthmore College takes a two-pronged approach to undergraduate education by integrating educational goals with robotics research. First, it offers courses in artificial intelligence, computer vision and robotics. Both AI and computer vision serve as prerequisites for the robotics course. Second, it involves students in ongoing research projects as part of their undergraduate experience. To keep up with the wide-ranging, fast-moving robotics field, education must be adaptive and multidisciplinary. The authors describe two undergraduate group projects they conducted, one from 1998 at the University of North Dakota advised by Maxwell, and one from 1999 at Swarthmore advised by both authors. The impetus for these projects was the American Association for Artificial Intelligence's (AAAI's) annual robot competition. These experiences led to the development of a new robotics course at Swarthmore, which they co-taught in the spring of 2000.	,Artificial intelligence;Computer science education;Educational institutions;Educational robots;Human robot interaction;Intelligent robots;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Robot vision systems;Service robots,computer science education;control engineering education;educational courses;robots;teachingAAAI robot competition;Swarthmore College;University of North Dakota;artificial intelligence;computer science education;computer vision;educational course;robotics education;robotics research;undergraduate education							
1506	Ferroelectric properties of Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12 thin films prepared by chemical solution deposition	Wu, Di; Li, Aidong; Zhu, Tao; Liu, Zhiguo; Ming, Naiben	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Ferroelectric Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12 (BLT) thin films were prepared on platinum coated silicon substrate by chemical solution deposition. The layered-perovskite phase was obtained by rapid thermal annealing the spin-on films at 650 or 700 ﾰC for 180 s. Scanning electron micrographs showed uniform surfaces composed of spherical grains. The grain size increased with increasing annealing temperature. The remanent polarization and coercive field of 650 ﾰC annealed film were 12.3 ?C/cm2 and 48.9 kV/cm, respectively, and those of 700 ﾰC annealed films were 18.2 ?C/cm2 and 51.1 kV/cm. BLT thin films showed little polarization fatigue under 250 kV/cm bipolar cycling at 50 kHz, while fatigue properties deteriorated with decreasing cycling field and frequency. At various frequencies from 1 Hz to 50 kHz, nonvolatile polarization Pnv showed nearly no degradation over an initial period of cycling, then decayed logarithmically with switching cycles. The onset of logarithmic decay of Pnv was found to increase linearly with cycling frequency. The cycling field dependence of fatigue characteristics was interpreted in terms of competition of charge trapping which blocks the domain switching and field-assisted detrapping of charged defects which set the locked domains free. Frequency dependent fatigue properties were discussed on the basis of drift and aggregation of oxygen vacancies. ﾩ 2000 American Institute of Physics.	aggregation;bismuth compounds;dielectric polarisation;ferroelectric materials;ferroelectric switching;ferroelectric thin films;grain size;lanthanum compounds;liquid phase deposition;rapid thermal annealing;scanning electron microscopy;spin coating;surface structure;vacancies (crystal)6172Cc;6172Ji;6180Ba;6835Bs;6855Jk;7722Ej;7755+f;7780Fm;7784Dy;8115Lm,							
1507	Noninteracting control with stability for Hamiltonian systems	Astolfi, A.; Menini, L.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The problem of noninteraction with stability via dynamic state feedback is addressed and solved for a class of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. A simple way to check necessary and sufficient conditions is proposed. It is well known that to decide if the problem is solvable, and which class of state feedback has to be used, the stability properties of some special dynamics are to be investigated. For this reason, on the way to the main result, it is shown that such dynamics are not necessarily Hamiltonian. Several examples, clarifying the role of different classes of state-feedback control laws (either static or dynamic) in the solution of the problem, are proposed	,Asymptotic stability;Control systems;Control theory;Helium;Linear systems;Nonlinear control systems;State feedback;Sufficient conditions,dynamics;nonlinear control systems;stability;state feedbackHamiltonian systems;dynamic state feedback;necessary and sufficient conditions;noninteracting control;stability properties

Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	In this article, we demonstrate that a randomly chosen ﾓ?ﾔ shape modulated superlattice can serve as a better energy filter than an unmodulated superlattice. The oscillation of transmission probability in the minibands of the ? shape modulated superlattice is shown to be greatly suppressed. We also demonstrate that precise control of the potential shape is not crucial for energy filters. The results should have prospective application in quantum cascade lasers, in which the improved energy filter can serve as the injection/relaxation region between active regions. ﾩ 2000 American Institute of Physics.	interface states;quantum well lasers;semiconductor superlattices4255Px;7320Dx;8530Vw,							
1512	Fuzzy logic and neural networks in power electronics and drives	Bose, B.K.	Industry Applications Magazine, IEEE	20020806	Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are finding increased applications in science and engineering. The application of AI techniques to household appliances, power systems, industrial and transport systems, medical equipment, etc., is increasing daily. AI techniques have made inroads to power electronics and drives to give more user-friendly, efficient, and improved dynamic performance, and robust and intelligent products. AI is basically embedding human intelligence into a machine so that it can think like a human being. AI is superior to human intelligence in some aspects. The computer with embedded AI techniques can process problems extremely fast compared to human beings; it can work continuously without tiring, and its problem-solving capability is not-affected by emotions and other human shortcomings. Advanced control based on artificial intelligence techniques is called intelligent control. Unlike classical control, intelligent control strategy may not need the mathematical model of the plant. Intelligent control can be visualized as a type of adaptive control. In this article, the application of fuzzy logic and neural network techniques to power electronics and electrical drives has been briefly described	,Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Biomedical engineering;Fuzzy logic;Humans;Intelligent control;Machine intelligence;Neural networks;Power electronics;Power system dynamics,adaptive control;electric drives;fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;fuzzy neural nets;intelligent control;power electronicsadaptive control;artificial intelligence;drives;fuzzy logic;fuzzy neural network;household appliances;human intelligence;intelligent control;medical equipment;neural networks;power electronics;power systems;transport systems							
1513	Having a robot attend AAAI 2000	Michaud, F.; Audet, J.; Letourneau, D.	Intelligent Systems and their Applications, IEEE	20020806	Having robot assistants represent us in meetings, shop for us, or do chores, for instance, would be useful. But to do so, robots must be able to face the contingencies of the real world by making the most of their sensing, actuating, processing, and reasoning abilities. To promote research efforts in that direction, the AAAI has been organizing the Mobile Robot Challenge since 1999. This initiative aims to present the robotics community with a new challenge that drives ongoing research and provides an effective public venue for demonstrating significant new work. The task is to make a robot attend the National Conference on AI. The robot is placed at the conference center??s front door and must navigate to the registration desk by following signs and asking for directions. At the registration desk, the robot receives a map of the conference hall, a destination conference room, and a deadline by which to reach it. While going to the conference room, the robot might have to take the elevator, schmooze with important people, or handle additional tasks such as guarding a room for a few minutes. When the robot reaches the conference room, it must give a two-minute presentation about itself. This past August the authors entered their robot, Lolitta Hall, into the competition at AAAI 2000 in Austin, Texas. The robot is a a Pioneer 2 robot with 16 sonars, a pan-tilt-zoom camera, a Pentium MMX 233-MHz onboard computer, and an infrared ring for detecting the charging station. Lolitta??s integrated skills are described and discussed.	,Elevators;HTML;Humans;Image recognition;Manipulators;Navigation;Robots;Skin;Sonar detection							
1514	A fuzzy neural network based on fuzzy hierarchy error approach	Wu, A.; Tam, P.K.S.	Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	This paper presents a novel fuzzy neural network which consists of an antecedent network and a consequent network. The antecedent network matches the premises of the fuzzy rules and the consequent network implements the consequences of the rules. In the network learning and training phase, a concise and effective algorithm based on the fuzzy hierarchy error approach is proposed to update the parameters of the network. This algorithm is simple to implement and it does not require as many calculations as some other classic neural network learning algorithms. A model reference adaptive control structure incorporating the proposed fuzzy neural network is studied.

1515	A new method for treating fluorine wastewater to reduce sludge and running costs	Toyoda, A.; Taira, T.	Semiconductor Manufacturing, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Reduction of the sludge generated in fluorine wastewater treatment is a critical problem for the semiconductor industry. We have developed a new method for treating fluorine wastewater in order to reduce sludge and running costs. This method utilizes a small amount of Al(OH)3  not only as an aggregator for CaF2 generated from fluoride ions in the wastewater but also as an effective fluorine adsorbent. The Al(OH)3 as fluorine adsorbent is used repeatedly through an AI(OH)3 reclamation process. This method can effectively treat the concentrated fluorine wastewater to achieve an exceedingly low concentration in one-step treatment. We constructed a practical treatment system using this method by modifying part of an existing conventional system. This new treatment system is able to reduce both the total sludge and running costs to about one-tenth those of a conventional system	,Calcium;Capacitance;Costs;Electronics industry;Industrial waste;Manufacturing processes;National electric code;Semiconductor materials;Sludge treatment;Wastewater treatment,fluorine;integrated circuit economics;water pollution control;water treatmentAl(OH)3;CaF2;adsorbent;aggregator;one-step treatment;reclamation process;running costs;semiconductor industry;sludge;wastewater treatment							
1516	Characterization of metalorganic decomposition-derived SrBi2Ta2O9 thin films with different thicknesses	Wu, Di; Li, Aidong; Ling, Huiqin; Yu, Tao; Liu, Zhiguo; Ming, Naiben	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Ferroelectric capacitors having sputtered Pt bottom and top electrodes and metalorganic decomposition derived ferroelectric thin films of SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) were prepared. The thickness effects on the structure, surface morphology, and electrical properties of SBT thin films were studied and discussed. Structure and surface morphology were analyzed by x-ray diffraction and atomic force microscope. The electrical properties were characterized by the measurements of hysteresis, capacitance, and pulse switching. The crystalline structure, grain size, and electrical properties do not depend on film thickness when films are less than 440 nm thick. A larger grain size is observed for films thicker than 440 nm, which results in a larger remnant polarization. The thickness dependence of the coercive voltage and reciprocal capacitance can be explained by an interfacial layer model. The thickness-independent coercive field and dielectric constant, calculated from the interfacial layer model, are around 19 kV/cm and 343, respectively. Nonvolatile polarization (Pnv), obtained from pulse-switching measurements, increases with the applied electric field and finally saturates with a slight thickness effect. The relaxation of the remnant polarization that occurs at zero-voltage intervals between the pulses and the thickness-independent behavior of Pnv are explained based on depolarization fields within the ferroelectric due to nonswitching interfacial layers at the film/electrode interfaces. ﾩ 2000 American Institute of Physics.

1518	Fatigue study of metalorganic-decomposition-derived SrBi2Ta2O9 thin films: The effect of partial switching	Wu, Di; Li, Aidong; Ling, Huiqin; Yu, Tao; Liu, Zhiguo; Ming, Naiben	Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Fatigue characteristics of metalorganic-decomposition derived SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) ferroelectric thin films were investigated with varying film thickness, capacitor size, switching pulse amplitude, and pulse width. The effect of partial switching on fatigue was studied. An increase of nonvolatile polarization (Pnv) was observed over the initial period of fatigue when the capacitor was fully switched by the applied bipolar cycles. Fatigue increases with decreasing applied field and pulse width. These support the idea that fatigue in SBT may be viewed as a competition between domain-wall pinning and field-assisted unpinning. Partial switching caused by small field and short pulse width enhances charge trapping at domain walls, thus increasing fatigue. ﾩ 2000 American Institute of Physics.	bismuth compounds;dielectric hysteresis;dielectric polarisation;electric domain walls;ferroelectric capacitors;ferroelectric ceramics;ferroelectric switching;ferroelectric thin films;strontium compounds7722Ej;7755+f;7780Dj;7780Fm;7784Dy;8105Je,

Intelligent Systems and their Applications, IEEE	20020806	The transition to the next millennium gives us an opportunity to reflect on the past and project the future. In this spirit, we have asked a set of distinguished scholars and practitioners who were involved in AI's formative stages to describe the most notable trend or controversy (or nontrend or noncontroversy) during AI's development. The responses provide an interesting characterization of AI-and, in many ways, of the people of AI. We gave our contributors a great deal of flexibility in the nature of their responses. Some provided grand summaries of the history of the field as a whole. Others commented insightfully on more focused topics. Some observed changes and changed along with them. Others are still making advances on research agendas articulated presciently long ago. Some are optimistic. Others are pessimistic. Despite the range, both individually and collectively they provide insights into where we have been and where we are going. Although each contribution is a unique expression of its author's glimpse back through AI's development, there is repetition of important themes that are at the discipline's core.

1520	An AI embedded object-oriented approach for formulating computable general equllibrium	Tong, Li; Shuheng, Chen; Shan, Feng	Systems Engineering and Electronics, Journal of	20120117	This paper proposes and illustrates an AI embedded object-oriented methodology to formulate the computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. In this framework, a CGE model is viewed as a collection of objects embedded AI or namely agents in computer world, corresponding to economic agents and entities in real world, such as government, households, markets and so on. A frame representation of major objects in CGE model is used for trade and environment. Embedded AI object-oriented approach (or software agent) is used in the CGE model representation can able to narrow the gap among the sernantic representation, formal CGE (mathematical) representation and computer and algorithm representation, and to improve CGE in understanding and maintenance etc. In such a system, constructing a CGE model to appear an intuitive process rather than an abstract process. This intuitive. process needs more understanding of the substance of economics and the logic underlying the problem rather than mathematical notation.

1521	Visual routines for eye location using learning and evolution	Huang, J.; Wechsler, H.	Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Eye location is used as a test bed for developing navigation routines implemented as visual routines within the framework of adaptive behavior-based AI. The adaptive eye location approach seeks first where salient objects are, and then what their identity is. Specifically, eye location involves: 1) the derivation of the saliency attention map, and 2) the possible classification of salient locations as eve regions. The saliency (ﾓwhereﾔ) map is derived using a consensus between navigation routines encoded as finite-state automata exploring the facial landscape and evolved using genetic algorithms (GAs). The classification (ﾓwhatﾔ) stage is concerned with the optimal selection of features, and the derivation of decision trees, using GAs, to possibly classify salient locations as eyes. The experimental results, using facial image data, show the feasibility of our method, and suggest a novel approach for the adaptive development of task-driven active perception and navigational mechanisms	,Animation;Artificial intelligence;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Eyes;Face detection;Face recognition;Genetic algorithms;Navigation;Testing,active vision;decision trees;feature extraction;finite automata;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);optical tracking;pattern classificationBaldwin effect;active perception;adaptive eye location;decision trees;facial image;feature extraction;finite-state automata;genetic algorithms;navigation routines;pattern classification;saliency							
1522	Recent developments of induction motor drives fault diagnosis using AI techniques	Filippetti, F.; Franceschini, G.; Tassoni, C.; Vas, P.	Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	This paper presents a review of the developments in the field of diagnosis of electrical machines and drives based on artificial intelligence (AI). It covers the application of expert systems, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and fuzzy logic systems that can be integrated into each other and also with more traditional techniques. The application of genetic algorithms is considered as well. In general, a diagnostic procedure starts from a fault tree developed on the basis of the physical behavior of the electrical system under consideration. In this phase, the knowledge of well-tested models able to simulate the electrical machine in different fault conditions is fundamental to obtain the patterns characterizing the faults. The fault tree navigation performed by an expert system inference engine leads to the choice of suitable diagnostic indexes, referred to a particular fault, and relevant to build an input data set for specific AI (NNs, fuzzy logic, or neuro-fuzzy) systems. The discussed methodologies, that play a general role in the diagnostic field, are applied to an induction machine, utilizing as input signals the instantaneous voltages and currents. In addition, the supply converter is also considered to incorporate in the diagnostic procedure the most typical failures of power electronic components. A brief description of the various AI techniques is also given; this highlights the advantages and the limitations of using AI techniques.

1525	Intelligent control of a planning system for astronaut training	Ortiz, J.; Guanrong Chen	Aerospace and Electronic Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	This work intends to design, analyze and solve, from the systems control perspective, a complex, dynamic, and multiconstrained planning system for generating training plans for crew members of the NASA-led International Space Station. Various intelligent planning systems have been developed within the framework of artificial intelligence. These planning systems generally lack a rigorous mathematical formalism to allow a reliable and flexible methodology for their design, modeling, and performance analysis in a dynamical, time-critical, and multiconstrained environment. Formulating the planning problem in the domain of discrete-event systems under a unified framework such that it can be modeled, designed, and analyzed as a control system will provide a self-contained theory for such planning systems. This will also provide a means to certify various planning systems for operations in the dynamical and complex environments in space.

1530	Virtual spiders guide robotic control design	Krink, T.; Vollruth, F.	Intelligent Systems and their Applications, IEEE	20020806	Traditionally, researchers have studied natural science phenomena by describing observations and by experimentally isolating and analyzing pertinent parameters and factors. As computational power has mushroomed in recent years, analysis of biological systems has increasingly involved formal models coupled with computer simulations. Lately, investigators have turned to individual-based models that mimic the complexity of biological processes by using repeated local interactions between units, described in few simple behavior rules. By mimicking plant morphology or the problem-solving capabilities of ﾓsocialﾔ robots, computer scientists can use a comparable concept for simulation, applied chaos theory, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. In our approach, called TheseusV, we used this approach to mimic the spatial orientation of spiders during web construction. As this article shows, behavioral principles of arthropods (spiders and insects) during orientation are interesting not only for research into the behavior of real animals, but also because their robustness and simplicity make them potentially quite useful for controlling autonomous agents such as insect robots. After all, most real bugs are notoriously good at coping with unpredictable environments, so lessons we learn from animal models can also enhance artificial-life models and offer new insight into spatial orientation to AI researchers	,Animals;Artificial intelligence;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Computer simulation;Control design;Coupled mode analysis;Insects;Power system modeling;Robots,artificial intelligence;artificial life;biology computing;legged locomotionTheseusV;applied chaos theory;artificial intelligence;artificial life;artificial-life models;behavioral principles;biological processes;insect robots;robotic control design;spatial orientation;spiders;web construction

Applied Superconductivity, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Niobium-aluminum precursor strands were fabricated using the conventional jelly roll method with two Nb:Al volume ratios, 3:1, and 5:1. These mono-elements were restacked in 7-, 19- and 36-core arrangements and drawn down to wires approximately 0.8 mm and 0.4 mm in diameter. Short lengths of wire were resistively heated under high vacuum to temperatures as high as 2200/spl deg/C for various times, and either allowed to cool by radiation plus lead conduction or quenched into liquid gallium. Vacuum cooling led to a disordered A15 phase, which was then ordered by annealing at 800/spl deg/C; gallium quenching tended to produce the bcc phase, which could be transformed into A15 also by annealing for various times at 800/spl deg/C. The superconducting properties of the final wires were examined by vibrating-sample magnetometry (/spl chi//sub dc/ and T/sub c/) as well as transport J/sub c/ measurement. Best results so far are for a 5:1 Nb:AI volume ratio sample Ga quenched from 2000/spl deg/C with a secondary reaction of 800/spl deg/C/3 h, giving J/sub c/=4.5/spl times/10/sup 8/ A/m/sup 2/ at 12 T, with a T/sub c/=18-18.5 K.	,Annealing;Heating;High temperature superconductors;Magnetic materials;Materials science and technology;Multifilamentary superconductors;Niobium;Superconducting magnets;Superconductivity;Wires,aluminium alloys;annealing;critical current density (superconductivity);niobium alloys;quenching (thermal);superconducting tapes;superconducting transition temperature;type II superconductors0.4 mm;0.8 mm;18 K;2200 C;800 C;Nb/sub 3/Al;Nb/sub 3/Al precursor strand;annealing;disordered A15 phase;jelly roll method;reel-to-reel process development;short-sample quenching;superconducting properties

1537	A novel approach to fault diagnosis in multicircuit transmission lines using fuzzy ARTmap neural networks	Aggarwal, R.K.; Xuan, Q.Y.; Johns, A.T.; Furong Li; Bennett, A.	Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Addresses the problems of fault diagnosis in complex multicircuit transmission systems, in particular those arising due to mutual coupling between the two parallel circuits under different fault conditions; the problems are compounded by the fact that this mutual coupling is highly variable in nature. In this respect, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide the ability to classify the faulted phase/phases by identifying different patterns of the associated voltages and currents. A fuzzy ARTmap (adaptive resonance theory) neural network is employed and is found to be well-suited for solving the complex fault classification problem under various system and fault conditions. Emphasis is placed on introducing the background of AI techniques as applied to the specific problem, followed by a description of the methodology adopted for training the fuzzy ARTmap neural network, which is proving to be a very useful and powerful tool for power system engineers. Furthermore, this classification technique is compared with a neural network technique based on the error backpropagation training algorithm, and it is shown that the former technique is better suited for solving the fault diagnosis problem in complex multicircuit transmission systems	,Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Circuit faults;Fault diagnosis;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Mutual coupling;Neural networks;Resonance;Voltage,ART neural nets;fault diagnosis;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power transmission faults;power transmission lines;transmission network calculationserror backpropagation training algorithm;fault classification;fault conditions;fuzzy ARTmap neural networks;multicircuit transmission lines;mutual coupling							
1538	A simulation approach based on negotiation and cooperation between agents: a case study	Fischer, K.; Chaib-draa, B.; Muller, J.P.; Pischel, M.; Gerber, C.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Presents AGENDA (A GENeral testbed for Distributed AI Applications), a simulation tool developed for the simulation and design of applications involving interacting entities. This testbed consists of two different levels, the architecture level and the system development level. The architecture level describes a methodology for designing software agents by providing several important functionalities an agent should have. On the other hand, the system development level provides the basic knowledge representation formalism, general inference mechanisms, and a simulation tool-box supporting visualization and monitoring of agents. Following this, the applicability of AGENDA to the transportation domain is presented in detail. The main challenge of AGENDA in the context of this domain has been to provide different cooperation-scalable methods based on negotiation, leading to different scheduling mechanisms, and to experimentally evaluate these mechanisms. This evaluation shows that: (1) AGENDA is suitable for realistic application in the transportation domain; (2) the mechanisms used for vertical negotiation (between trucks considered as agents) and for horizontal negotiation (between companies considered as agents) are applicable for the real-world transportation domain applications. Finally, a complete study of the scalability of the simulation tool and the algorithms used for the negotiation is presented. This study, along with the evaluation of the different mechanisms, can help designers of transportation companies, particularly in the case of large companies	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computer architecture;Design methodology;Inference mechanisms;Knowledge representation;Software agents;Software design;System testing;Transportation,digital simulation;distributive data processing;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;multi-agent systems;scheduling;transportationAGENDA;agent cooperation;agent monitoring;agent negotiation;agent visualization;application design;architecture level;case study;cooperation-scalable methods;distributed AI applications;experimental evaluation;general inference mechanisms;horizontal negotiation;interacting entities;knowledge representation formalism;scalability;scheduling mechanisms;simulation tool;software agent design methodology;system development level;transportation companies;transportation domain;trucks;vertical negotiation

1540	Batch distributed sample acquisition for M-ary signaling DS/CDMA systems	Kim, Byoung-Hoon; Lee, Byeong Gi	Communications and Networks, Journal of	20130912	In this paper, we propose a batch distributed sample acquisition(BDSA) scheme applicable to a DS/CDMA system employing the Ai-ary signaling for data transmission. While the primitive distributed sample acquisition(DSA) scheme can be employed only for the binary signaling systems which transmit one bit per symbol, the proposed BDSA scheme extends its applicability to the general signaling systems allowing multi-bit transmission per symbol. Since the BDSA contains the primitive DSA as a special case of M=2, it may be regarded as a generalized DSA system. For the construction of the BDSA system, we resort to the igniter sequence concept and the non-uniform sampling and correction scheme of the distributed sample scrambling(DSS). In the BDSA receiver the igniter sequence is synchronized first, which takes very short time due to its short period, and then the state symbol composed of log2M state samples of the transmitter main shift register generator(SRG) is decoded successively and supplied for the synchronization of the receiver main SRG. The DSS technique imbedded in the BDSA scheme enables synchronizing the receiver main SRG in a few state symbol transmissions. Through a design study we confirm that the BDSA scheme contributes to speeding up the acquisition time as well as to saving the hardware cost by enabling the reuse of the data transceiver circuitry for the synchronization process.

1541	Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction study of PbTiO3 thin films prepared by solﾖgel technique	Li, Ai-Dong; Wu, Di; Ge, Chuan-Zhen; Lu, Peng; Ma, Wen-Hui; Zhang, Ming&#x2010;Sheng; Xu, Cun-Yi; Zuo, Jian; Ming, Nai&#x2010;ben	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	PbTiO3 (PT) thin films were prepared by the solﾖgel technique on Si(111) single crystal, fused quartz, and NaCl substrates using two precursor solutions: methanol and 2-methoxyethanol. Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction were used to determine the effects of the precursor solution, substrate, annealing temperature, and film thickness on the film structure and crystallization behavior. The results indicate that the precursor solution plays an important role in the fabrication of pure perovskite PbTiO3 films. The films deposited from methanol solution are able to form the perovskite structure at lower crystallization temperature (?430 ﾰC). In contrast, the films deposited from 2-methoxyethanol solution easily form the pyrochlore phase. This is ascribed to the different mechanism of hydrolysis and condensation polymerization of the two precursor solutions. The Raman scattering results on various substrates have significant and interesting differences, especially for the films deposited from 2-methoxyethanol solution. In addition, with increasing the annealing temperature and film thickness, the full width of the Raman peaks at half-maximum decreases and the intensity increases. As to the position of the peaks, most Raman modes of PT films shift to lower frequencies due to the pressure effect in the films. ﾩ 1999 American Institute of Physics.

1542	Choosing the right model	Leitch, R.R.; Shen, Q.; Coghill, G.M.; Chantler, M.J.	Control Theory and Applications, IEE Proceedings -	20020806	The authors consider models to be executable descriptions of the real world, that is a model can be used to predict or analyse properties of the system. Simulation and reasoning systems, which may be derived from traditional or AI approaches, are used to execute these models. Given the plethora of modelling techniques available which cope well with certain, but not other, contexts, it is evident that there is no `best model' covering all situations: a model is correct if it satisfies its purpose no less and no more. The desires of the user of a modelling system are always moderated by the availability of techniques permitting these desires to be met. To alleviate the difficulties associated with this requires a methodology to guide the user to the best model and simulation technique to meet his needs. A primary requirement in the construction of such a methodology is a comprehensive and understandable classification of the choices inherent in the construction of a model	classification;inference mechanisms;modelling;simulationbehavioural choice;classification;modeling;models;ontology;reasoning;representational choice;simulation							
1543	The Creatures Global Digital Ecosystem	Cliff, D; Grand, S	Artificial Life	20140519	An artificial life entertainment-software product called Creatures was released in Europe in late 1996 and in the United States and Japan in mid-1997. When installed on a domestic computer (PC or Macintosh), each Creatures CD-ROM creates a virtual world in which autonomous software agents exist. The agents, known as ﾓnorns,ﾔ interact with the human user, with each other, and with objects in their virtual world. Each norn coordinates perception and action via its own modular recurrent neural network: Each network has Hebbian learning, plus diffuse modulation of activity via a ﾓhormonalﾔ system that is part of that norn's ﾓbiochemistry.ﾔ Details of each norn's neural network and biochemistry are genetically specified, and norns can breed via sexual reproduction. In the reproduction process, genetic material may be mutated and may also be subjected to ﾓgene duplicationsﾔ that enable potentially unlimited increases in complexity of the norns' design. Over 500,000 Creatures CD-ROMS have now been sold. As each installed copy of Creatures can support 5 to 10 simultaneously existing individual norns, it seems reasonable to estimate that there are up to 5 million norns existing in the ﾓcyberspaceﾔ provided by the global Creatures user community. Continued growth of the global norn population, to figures measured in tens of millions, is quite likely. Although a commercial product, the Creatures digital ecosystem should be of interest to artificial life scientists: There are obvious parallels with Yaeger's Poly World and Ray's Net Tierra systems. This article provides a detailed discussion of the links between the artificial life literature and the technology used in Creatures and includes anecdotal discussion of the ﾓdigital naturalismﾔ witnessed on the many independent - ebsites maintained by Creatures enthusiasts.	artificial ecosystems;digital organisms;entertainment software

1545	Fuzzy logic-a modern perspective	Yen, J.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Traditionally, fuzzy logic has been viewed in the artificial intelligence (AI) community as an approach for managing uncertainty. In the 1990s, however, fuzzy logic has emerged as a paradigm for approximating a functional mapping. This complementary modern view about the technology offers new insights about the foundation of fuzzy logic, as well as new challenges regarding the identification of fuzzy models. In this paper, we first review some of the major milestones in the history of developing fuzzy logic technology. After a short summary of major concepts in fuzzy logic, we discuss a modern view about the foundation of two types of fuzzy rules. Finally, we review some of the research in addressing various challenges regarding automated identification of fuzzy rule-based models	,Artificial intelligence;Computer industry;Costs;Function approximation;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy reasoning;History;Possibility theory;Problem-solving;Uncertainty,artificial intelligence;function approximation;fuzzy logic;history;identification;inference mechanisms;reviews;uncertainty handlingapproximate reasoning;artificial intelligence;automated fuzzy model identification;functional mapping approximation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rules;history;possibility theory;review;soft computing;technology development;uncertainty management							
1546	Adaptation in the presence of a general nonlinear parameterization: an error model approach	Ai-Poh Loh; Annaswamy, A.M.; Skantze, F.P.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Parametric uncertainties in adaptive estimation and control have been dealt with, by and large, in the context of linear parameterizations. Algorithms based on the gradient descent method either lead to instability or inaccurate performance when the unknown parameters occur nonlinearly. Complex dynamic models are bound to include nonlinear parameterizations which necessitate the need for new adaptation algorithms that behave in a stable and accurate manner. The authors introduce, in this paper, an error model approach to establish these algorithms and their global stability and convergence properties. A number of applications of this error model in adaptive estimation and control are included, in each of which the new algorithm is shown to result in global boundedness.

1547	Have we witnessed a real-life Turing Test?	Krol, M.	Computer	20020806	Did Deep Blue ace the Turing Test? Did it do much more? It seems that the IBM creation not only beat the reigning chess World Champion Gary Kasparov, but also took a large step, in some people's eyes, toward true artificial intelligence. For AI professionals, a computer defeating a human in chess is probably neither surprising nor really significant. After all, they contend, chess can be described in terms of a nondeterministic alternating Turing machine. Despite the enormous number of possible positions and available moves, the task does not present a challenging theoretical AI problem of NP completeness. There are many well-developed AI strategies that limit the search for the best move to an analysis of the most promising positions. Therefore, the progress in logical and numerical methods of AI and a computer's computational speed and available memory made the computer's victory inevitable. Deep Blue's victory, then, was attributable to its ability to analyze 200 million positions per second and a refined algorithm that accounted for positional-in addition to material-advantage. In summary, most AI professionals conclude that the computer won by brute force, rather than a sophisticated or original strategy. What most AI experts have overlooked, though, is another aspect of the match, which may signify a milestone in the history of computer science: for the first time, a computer seems to have passed the Turing Test	,Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Game theory;History;Humans;IEEE news;Machine intelligence;Testing;Turing machines,Turing machines;artificial intelligence;games of skillAI professionals;AI strategies;Deep Blue;IBM creation;chess World Champion;nondeterministic alternating Turing machine;real life Turing Test;true artificial intelligence

1550	Voice QoS in third-generation mobile systems	Valko, A.G.; Ra&#x0301;cz, A.; Fodor, G.	Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on	20020806	We analyze voice quality and system performance in third-generation mobile communication systems. We argue that in these networks that are expected to integrate voice, data, and multimedia services, the transport network can no longer be considered as a lossless transparent traffic channel. Rather, proper dimensioning is needed even for plain voice services. Furthermore, the efficient utilization of the network resources shared by voice and data traffic requires sophisticated traffic management in the statistical multiplexing environment. The contribution of the paper is twofold: first, voice quality in the cellular transport network is analyzed and network dimensioning criteria are derived. Second, building on advances reported in the literature and taking into consideration current standardization activities, a joint performance model is established for the air interface (AI) and the transmission network (TN) allowing for the analysis of end-to-end service performance within a uniform framework. To demonstrate the applicability of this model, we point to some performance problems in the multiservice environment and suggest and evaluate traffic management actions to overcome these	,Cellular networks;Environmental management;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Quality of service;Resource management;Speech analysis;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control,broadband networks;cellular radio;code division multiple access;integrated voice/data communication;multimedia communication;network interfaces;packet radio networks;quality of service;radio networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication trafficCDMA-ATM wideband mobile network;air interface;cellular transport network;data services;end-to-end service performance;joint performance model;lossless transparent traffic channel;multimedia services;multiservice environment;network dimensioning;network resources;protocols;standardization activities;statistical multiplexing;system performance;third-generation mobile systems;traffic management;transmission network;transport network;voice QoS;voice quality;voice services

Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, IEEE	20020806	Acupuncture meridian system theory is none of the main features of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The meridians are thought to be the pathways for qi (or bioenergy), which then circulates throughout the human body. They originate in the internal organs and from there travel up to the skin. Bilaterally opposite, symmetric acupunctures along the main meridians (called Great Acupuncture) and along the branching meridians (called opposite insertion) are two traditional methods of acupuncture commonly used in clinics. Symmetric acupoints are punctured opposite to the diseased or affected side. This article discusses the authors' work in which they used 80 healthy subjects to study the symmetry or preferred direction of electrical conduction of human meridians. The data were then analyzed by paired-t and ANOVA testing procedures.	,Analysis of variance;Artificial intelligence;Biomedical engineering;Current measurement;Humans;Medical tests;Skin;Testing;Voltage,bioelectric phenomena;electrical conductivity;medicineANOVA testing;Great Acupuncture;bilaterally opposite symmetric acupunctures;bilaterally symmetrical acupoints;bioenergy;branching meridians;diseased side;electric conduction symmetry;healthy subjects;internal organs;opposite insertion;paired-t testing;preferential direction;qi pathways;skin;traditional Chinese medicineAdolescent;Adult;Analysis of Variance;Electric Conductivity;Electromagnetic Fields;Female;Functional Laterality;Humans;Male;Meridians;Middle Aged;Reference Values							
1553	Gleaning the Web	Kushmerik, N.	Intelligent Systems and their Applications, IEEE	20020806	We are drowning in words. E-mail and Web browsers provide access to myriad sources of text, from newswires to product catalogs, from recipes to movie schedules, but we can pause just a tiny fraction of the available terabytes. The cliche is born: information overload, which threatens to swamp the Internet's promised productivity gains, educational benefits, and entertainment value. In recent years, computer science has risen to this challenge, with substantial progress on systems for retrieving and filtering text. Information extraction systems provide a complementary service. IE is the task of identifying the specific fragments of a single document that constitute its core semantic content. Scalability is the major challenge to IE. IE systems usually rely on extraction rules tailored to a particular document collection. If this knowledge is hand-crafted, porting an IE system to new collections will be expensive. Recent research has led to the identification of important classes of Internet IE tasks for which highly scalable systems have been developed. I describe these IE tasks and explain how machine learning yields highly scalable IE systems, and discuss remaining challenges and argue that scaling up AI applications on the Internet is an important challenge to machine learning	,Catalogs;Computer science;Data mining;Electronic mail;Filtering;Internet;Machine learning;Motion pictures;Processor scheduling;Productivity,Internet;information resources;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);online front-endsInternet;Web browsers;document collection;e-mail;information extraction;information overload;machine learning;scalability;semantic content

1558	Agents on the move [mobile software agents]	Morreale, P.	Spectrum, IEEE	20020806	The author describes a new kind of software, based on artificial intelligence research, that can move itself from place to place to help people work more effectively. Known as agents, these artificial assistants are software components that live inside computer environments. Developed out of research in artificial intelligence (AI), agents were made in a variety of forms to perform all sorts of useful work-including obtaining airline departure dates and times, filtering e-mail for messages the user considers important, alerting users to significant stock price changes, and a host of other tasks. At first, agents were constrained to a single computer or at most to a single computing environment-a closed, homogenous network of, say, Unix platforms. Their behavior was limited and all the tasks they could do had to be pre-established. Today, agents are breaking the bonds that confine them to a single environment while learning new ways of accomplishing tasks on their own, based on their experience. The newcomers are called mobile agents, because they can move from one computer to another. As they emerge from the shadow of AI research, they are bringing together telecommunications, software, and distributed-system technologies to create new ways of getting things done	,Floods;Mobile agents,artificial intelligence;object-oriented methods;software agentsartificial assistants;artificial intelligence research;distributed-system technologies;mobile agents;object oriented code;software;software agents;software components;telecommunications

1561	Knowledge-based Multiagent Coordination	Laird, J; Jones, R; Nielsen, P	Presence	20140519	In many domains, intelligent agents must coordinate their activities in order for them to be successful both individually and collectively. Over the last ten years, research in distributed artificial intelligence has emphasized building knowledge-lean systems, where coordination emerges either from simple rules of behavior or from a deep understanding of general coordination strategies. In this paper, we contend that there is an alternative for domains in which the types and methods of coordination are well structured (even though the environment may be very unstructured and dynamic). The alternative is to build real-time, knowledge-based agents that have a broadﾗbut shallowﾗunderstanding of how to coordinate. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by example. Specifically, we have built agents that model the coordination performed by Navy and Air Force pilots and controllers in air-to-air and air-to-ground missions within a distributed interactive simulation environment. The major contribution of the paper is an examination of the requirements and approaches for supporting knowledge-based coordination, in terms of the structure of the domain, the agents' knowledge of the domain, and the underlying AI architecture.								
1562	AI techniques in induction machines diagnosis including the speed ripple effect	Filippetti, F.; Franceschini, G.; Tassoni, C.; Vas, P.	Industry Applications, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Various applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (expert systems, neural networks, and fuzzy logic) presented in the literature prove that such technologies are well suited to cope with on-line diagnostic tasks for induction machines. The features of these techniques and the improvements that they introduce in the diagnostic process are recalled, showing that, in order to obtain an indication on the fault extent, faulty machine models are still essential. Moreover, by the models, that must trade off between simulation result effectiveness and simplicity, it is possible to overcome crucial points of the diagnosis. With reference to rotor electrical faults of induction machines, a new and simple procedure based on a model which includes the speed ripple effect is developed. This procedure leads to a new diagnostic index, independent of the machine operating condition and inertia value, that allows the implementation of the diagnostic system with a minimum configuration intelligence	,Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Circuit faults;Diagnostic expert systems;Fuzzy logic;Induction machines;Industry Applications Society;Intelligent networks;Machine intelligence;Voltage,artificial intelligence;asynchronous machines;electric machine analysis computing;expert systems;fault diagnosis;fuzzy logic;machine theory;neural nets;rotorsAI techniques;artificial intelligence;expert systems;faulty machine models;fuzzy logic;induction machines diagnosis;minimum configuration intelligence;neural networks;rotor electrical faults;speed ripple effect

1564	Biology: see it again-for the first time	Luke, S.; Hamahashi, S.; Kyoda, K.; Ueda, H.	Intelligent Systems and their Applications, IEEE	20020806	Computer science owes a huge debt to biological systems. The field came about largely as an attempt to understand and replicate the function and abilities of the brain. From this early lineage have sprung many subfields derived largely from biological metaphors: computer vision, neural networks, evolutionary computation, robotics, multiagent studies, and much of artificial intelligence. In some areas, the computer has bested its biological counterparts in efficiency and simplicity. But for many domains the biological ﾓreal thingﾔ remains superior to the artificial algorithms that it inspired. While computer science has been simplifying its inspirations from biology, biologists have been catching up. Soon it will be possible to model entire neurosystems, gene-regulation mechanisms, evolutionary processes and even whole organisms on a computer. Given how much biological metaphors have inspired AI and computer science, biology can help reinvigorate many other AI subfields. Moreover, modeling and analysis promise to enable many things that have long been pipe dreams of autonomous robotics, artificial life, and cognitive science	,Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Biological system modeling;Biological systems;Biology computing;Computer science;Computer vision;Evolution (biology);Evolutionary computation,artificial intelligence;biology computing;computer scienceartificial intelligence;artificial life;biological metaphors;biological systems;biology;brain;cognitive science;computer science;computer vision;evolutionary computation;evolutionary processes;gene-regulation mechanisms;multiagent studies;neural networks;neurosystems;robotics							
1565	The future of object technology	Meyer, B.	Computer	20020806	In the future, object technology will not be confined to a niche. Objects will be pervasive; very little serious software will not be object-oriented at least in some way in 1998 and beyond. Object technology isn't a matter of fashion. It's simply that no-one really knows how to tackle the kind of sophisticated systems that our users now want, without using object technology. It's also that no one has found anything better. Since object technology came into prominence a decade ago, pundits have at various times predicted its demise, with the inevitable periodic announcements of the so-called ﾓObject Winterﾔ-an allusion to the ﾓAI Winterﾔ that froze the spread of artificial intelligence in the late 1970s-but winter has not come, and all the signs indicate that spring will continue	,Capability maturity model;Computer industry;Costs;Programming;Project management;Proposals;Quality management;Software development management;Software standards;Unified modeling language,object-oriented programming;technological forecastingObject Winter;future;object technology;object-oriented software;sophisticated systems							
1566	Agent jurisprudence	Huhns, M.N.; Singh, M.P.	Internet Computing, IEEE	20020806	The agent metaphor comes packaged with a number of powerful abstractions. Some of these are psychological, such as beliefs, knowledge, and intentions-abstractions that were traditionally studied in AI. However, there are a number of other abstractions that the agent metaphor brings to the fore. Of these, one has been emphasizing the social abstractions. Close cousins of the social abstractions are the ethical and legal abstractions. These too are being recognized as increasingly important in developing agents that are not only sociable, but also well behaved	,Artificial intelligence;Contracts;Ethics;Humans;Immune system;Internet;Law;Legal factors;Packaging;Psychology,social aspects of automation;software agentsagent metaphor;beliefs;ethical abstractions;intentions;knowledge;legal abstractions;psychological abstractions;social abstractions							
1567	A unified approach to topology generation and optimal sizing of floorplans	Dasgupta, P.S.; Sur-Kolay, S.; Bhattacharya, B.B.	Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Existing algorithms for floorplan topology generation by rectangular dualization usually do not consider sizing issues. In this paper, given a rectangularly dualizable adjacency graph and a set of aspect ratios of the modules, a topology which is likely to yield an optimally sized floorplan, is produced first in a top-down fashion by an AI-based search technique with novel heuristic estimates based on size parameters. It is shown that for any rectangular graph, there exists a feasible topology using only either straight or Z-cutlines recursively within a bounding rectangle. The significance of this result is four-fold: (1) considerable acceleration of the heuristic search, (2) topology generation with minimal number of nonslice cores, (3) guaranteed safe routing order without addition of pseudo modules, and (4) design of an efficient bottom-up heuristic for optimal sizing. Experimental results show that this integrated method elegantly solves floorplan optimization problem for general including inherently nonslicible adjacency graphs	,Acceleration;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization methods;Polynomials;Routing;Simulated annealing;Topology;Very large scale integration;Yield estimation,VLSI;circuit layout CAD;circuit optimisation;graph theory;integrated circuit layout;network routing;network topology;search problemsAI-based search technique;VLSI layout design;aspect ratios;bottom-up heuristic;floorplan optimization problem;floorplan topology generation;heuristic search;optimal sizing;rectangular graph;rectangularly dualizable adjacency graph;top-down fashion

The scenario is a fine-grained simulation of a sensor-based, non-holonomic mobile robot moving in a two dimensional environment in which are set paradigmatic short-term memory experiments involving delayed response tasks for the robotic subject. We set out our position initially in relation to symbolic AI. connectionism and nouvelle AI. In particular. we argue that despite its practical successes, the last named approach does not escape from a foundational error that in different guises undermines the programmatic aspirations of all three. We suggest that this representational problem is inherent in the implementational granularity of systems such as the subsumption architecture and argue for the notion of embedding in time, as a first step around the impasse.								
1570	A study of voltage fluctuation, noise and magnetic instability in spin valve GMR recording heads	Wallash, A.

Methodologies for detecting the fluctuation using a spin stand or an MR transfer curve tester are presented and used to study the phenomenon as a function of bias current and magnetic field. It is shown that the fluctuation only occurs within narrow ranges of sensor bias current, is suppressed by an external magnetic field and can result in a 7 dB increase in the noise floor at 10 MHz.

Two kinds of novel laser structures based on such technique are also proposed and fabricated. First, a laser diode with window region for high-power operation is designed and fabricated. The maximum output power of such a device shows an increase by 18% over laser diodes without interdiffused window region. Then a transverse mode controlled laser structure taking advantages of the refractive index change induced by MQW interdiffusion is realized using RTA technique.

1575	Deformable model of the human iris for measuring ocular torsion from video images	Ivins, J.P.; Porrill, J.; Frisby, J.P.	Vision, Image and Signal Processing, IEE Proceedings -	20020806	The authors describe a deformable model of the human iris, which forms part of a system for accurate offline measurement of binocular eye movements, particularly cyclotorsion (torsion), from video image sequences. At least two existing systems measure torsion from infrared video images by pupil tracking followed by cross-correlation of bandpass filtered iris sectors. Unfortunately, pupil expansion and contraction reduce the accuracy of this method. In addition, infrared iris images typically contain very little texture, so correlation can be unreliable. A five-parameter deformable model was therefore developed for taken in visible light. This model can translate (horizontal and vertical eye motion), rotate (torsion) and scale both uniformly and radially (pupil changes). A series of software simulations and hardware tests suggest that torsion measurements obtained with the model are repeatable and accurate to within 0.1ﾰ. This performance is illustrated by analysing binocular torsion during fixation on a static target; the results match previously published data from other equipment	biological techniques;biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;eye;image sequences;motion estimation;video signal processingbandpass filtered iris sectors;binocular eye movements;cross-correlation;cyclotorsion;deformable model;hardware tests;horizontal eye motion;human iris;ocular torsion measurement;offline measurement;pupil tracking;software simulations;static target;vertical eye motion;video image sequences;visible light

1577	Arbitration (or how to merge knowledge bases)	Liberatore, P.; Schaerf, M.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Knowledge-based systems must be able to ﾓintelligentlyﾔ manage a large amount of information coming from different sources and at different moments in time. Intelligent systems must be able to cope with a changing world by adopting a ﾓprincipledﾔ strategy. Many formalisms have been put forward in the artificial intelligence (AI) and database (DB) literature to address this problem. Among them, belief revision is one of the most successful frameworks to deal with dynamically changing worlds. Formal properties of belief revision have been investigated by Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson, who put forward a set of postulates stating the properties that a belief revision operator should satisfy. Among these properties, a basic assumption of revision is that the new piece of information is totally reliable and, therefore, must be in the revised knowledge base. Different principles must be applied when there are two different sources of information and each one has a different view of the situation-the two views contradicting each other. If we do not have any reason to consider any of the sources completely unreliable, the best we can do is to ﾓmergeﾔ the two views in a new and consistent one, trying to preserve as much information as possible. We call this merging process arbitration. In this paper, we investigate the properties that any arbitration operator should satisfy. In the style of Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson we propose a set of postulates, analyze their properties, and propose actual operators for arbitration	,Artificial intelligence;Database systems;Distributed databases;Information analysis;Information resources;Intelligent systems;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge management;Logic;Merging,belief maintenance;deductive databases;mergingarbitration;artificial intelligence;belief revision;database;intelligent systems;merging							
1578	Magnetic changes in GMR heads caused by electrostatic discharge	Wallash, A.; Kim, Young K.	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The effects of current transients on the magnetic response of GMR sensors is studied. It is shown that GMR sensors with an FeMn exchange layer exhibit large magnetic changes after a single ESD current transient. The energy which results in magnetic failure is only 0.9 nJ, which is much less than the 6 nJ which causes physical melting damage to the GMR sensor. These serious magnetic changes are explained in terms of resetting of the FeMn exchange layer direction due to the elevated temperature and internal magnetic field during the current transient. It is concluded that ESD stress testing of GMR sensors has revealed a new and important magnetic failure mechanism in GMR sensors	,Biological system modeling;Electrostatic discharge;Giant magnetoresistance;Immune system;Magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic fields;Magnetic heads;Magnetic sensors;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Testing,giant magnetoresistance;magnetic heads;magnetic sensors;magnetoresistive devices;transientsESD stress testing;FeMn exchange layer;GMR sensors;Ta-NiFe-Co-Cu-Co-NiFe-FeMn-Ta;current transients;electrostatic discharge;giant magnetoresistive heads;internal magnetic field;magnetic failure;melting damage							
1579	Adaptive Behavior in Autonomous Agents	Ziemke, T	Presence	20140519	This paper provides an overview of the bottom-up approach to artificial intelligence (AI), commonly referred to as behavior-oriented AI. The behavior-oriented approach, with its focus on the interaction between autonomous agents and their environments, is introduced by contrasting it with the traditional approach of knowledge-based AI. Different notions of autonomy are discussed, and key problems of generating adaptive and complex behavior are identified. A number of techniques for the generation of behavior are introduced and evaluated regarding their potential for realizing different aspects of autonomy as well as adaptivity and complexity of behavior. It is concluded that, in order to realize truly autonomous and intelligent agents, the behavior-oriented approach will have to focus even more on lifelike qualities in both agents and environments.

1583	High resolution x-ray diffraction study of Bragg peak width in strained InGaAs/InAlAs/InP heterostructures	Yang, Quankui; Aizhen Li; Chen, Jianxin	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Many different reflections have been investigated by high resolution x-ray diffraction on gas source molecular beam epitaxy grown strained InGaAs/InAlAs/InP heterostructures to study the Bragg peak widths. Results show that even deducting the influence of the intrinsic peak width and the influence of the instrument broadening, for either InGaAs or InAlAs epilayers, a linear relationship between the square of the Bragg peak width and tan2 ?B exists with ?B the Bragg angle, for either grazing incidence or grazing emergence geometry. Different slopes for the linear relationship have been measured in the two different geometries. Systematically, a much bigger peak width is detected under a grazing incidence geometry than that under a grazing emergence geometry for the same asymmetric reflection. The phenomenon is explained by the existence of a normal strain gradient along the growth direction of the epilayerﾒs thickness. This normal strain gradient has been confirmed by x-ray triple-axis two-dimensional mapping. Moreover, a broader peak width of the (117) reflection than that of the (155) reflection is consistent with the strain gradient. ﾩ 1998 American Institute of Physics.

1587	Evaluating different footprints parameters as a predictor of arch height	Tzyy-Yuang Shiang; Shin-Hwa Lee; Shwn-Jen Lee; Woei Chyn Chu	Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, IEEE	20020806	Some controversies still exist concerning the validity and efficacy of using footprint parameters to predict arch height. Some investigators have disputed the ability of using the footprint to characterize arch types, since factors other than arch height may contribute to the footprint. Chu and coworkers (1995) used a digital approach and included pressure information with AI, which they termed the modified arch index (MAI). Their results showed that significant correlation existed between the arch height and both the MAI (r=-0.71) and the AI (r=-0.70). The causes of the above-mentioned controversy have been believed to be due to errors introduced during the footprint acquisition and parameter extraction phases. The purpose of this study was to use the same digital approach as Chua to determine whether correlation existed between arch height and the other eight footprint parameters besides the MAI and AI. The objective of classifying foot arch type is to help people with abnormal foot structure prevent injury, and to help athletes enhance performance. The main purpose of footprint parameters is to provide an easily accessible and valid approach to reach this objective	,Artificial intelligence;Biomedical engineering;Digital cameras;Foot;Joining processes;Niobium;Pain;Rubber,biomechanics;sportabnormal foot structure;arch height;arch index;arch types;athletes;correlation;digital approach;foot arch type;footprint acquisition;footprint parameters;injury;modified arch index;parameter extraction;pressure information

1589	Evolution of Linguistic Diversity in a Simple Communication System	Arita, T; Koyama, Y	Artificial Life	20140519	This article reports on the current state of our efforts to shed light on the origin and evolution of linguistic diversity using synthetic modeling and artificial life techniques. We construct a simple abstract model of a communication system that has been designed with regard to referential signaling in nonhuman animals. We analyze the evolutionary dynamics of vocabulary sharing based on these experiments. The results show that mutation rates, population size, and resource restrictions define the classes of vocabulary sharing. We also see a dynamic equilibrium, where two states, a state with one dominant shared word and a state with several dominant shared words, take turns appearing. We incorporate the idea of the abstract model into a more concrete situation and present an agent-based model to verify the results of the abstract model and to examine the possibility of using linguistic diversity in the field of distributed AI and robotics. It has been shown that the evolution of linguistic diversity in vocabulary sharing will support cooperative behavior in a population of agents.	communication;evolution;genetic algorithms;linguistic diversity							
1590	Anarchy in action [AI software complexity]	Grand, S.	Intelligent Systems and their Applications, IEEE	20020806	As software complexity grows (which it inevitably does), the problems of managing that complexity grow exponentially. Nowhere is this more significant than in AI, where we are attempting to emulate some of the most sophisticated and complex forms of behavior. It is a reasonable assertion that intelligent systems cannot be simplified-that their behavior is necessarily a result of their immense complexity. If we are to make intelligent computer programs, they must be complex. If that complexity exceeds our ability to manage it by conventional top-down modes of thought, then we must find another way. To do this, we need to understand how anarchy works. One of the largest anarchies on the face of this planet is your own body. Perhaps the most striking feature of complex organisms is their cellularity. A cell's most significant feature is its membrane. The membrane's purpose is to keep the outside out and the inside in. Modern software uses a similar concept to isolate components from each other, through the object-oriented programming methodology. In many respects, the biological concept of cellularity is applicable to computer software, especially if you have a predilection for designing bottom-up, massively parallel simulations for creating intelligent artificial life-forms	,Artificial intelligence;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Biomembranes;Concurrent computing;Intelligent systems;Object oriented programming;Organisms;Planets;Software,artificial intelligence;biocybernetics;chaos;computational complexity;programming;programming theoryanarchy;artificial intelligence;biological metaphor;bottom-up design;cell membrane;cellularity;complex behaviour;complex organisms;intelligent artificial life-forms;intelligent computer programs;massively parallel simulations;object-oriented programming;software complexity

However, the essays make it equally clear that we must answer many new, intriguing questions to achieve the tantalizing goal of having a computer do for us what Charles Lutwidge Dodgson did more than a century ago for Alice Lidell and her sisters	,Biomedical monitoring;Books;Character generation;Feeds;Intelligent agent;Intelligent robots;Mood;Safety,interactive systems;literature;natural languagesAI;character-based interactive story systems;coherent plots;computer graphics;computer science;interactive fiction;natural-language understanding							
1593	AI in the White House: expert system diagnoses bounced e-mail	Hedberg, S.	IEEE Expert	20020806	Every once in a while an AI application comes along that stands out, not only for its technical merit, but more for its strategic merit. The paper discusses such an application at the White House. While it will be largely invisible, nestled into an electronic media affairs distribution system, it is noteworthy for several reasons. First, AI will soon be living at the White House, the powerful symbol of the US government. Second, it exemplifies the kind of support functions AI can perform in this new age of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). Third, this expert system was built by an AI scientist, based on his own expertise, to lighten his own workload. For the Clinton Administration, Comlink was a good way to practice what it preached; to actually get on the information superhighway by making government information widely available to the public via e-mail	,Artificial intelligence;Data structures;Databases;Diagnostic expert systems;Electronic mail;Expert systems;Internet;Knowledge based systems;Postal services;Subscriptions,Internet;electronic mail;expert systems;government data processingClinton Administration;Comlink;Internet;National Information Infrastructure;US government;White House;artificial intelligence application;e-mail;expert system;information superhighway;media affairs distribution system;strategic merit;technical merit							
1594	A data/knowledge paradigm for the modeling and design of operations support systems	Vaishnavi, V.K.; Buchanan, G.C.; Kuechler, W.L., Jr.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The paper develops the Smart Object paradigm and its instantiation, which provide a new conceptualization for the modeling, design, and development of an important but little researched class of information systems, operations support systems (OSS). OSS is the authors' term for systems which provide interactive support for the management of large, complex operations environments, such as manufacturing plants, military operations, and large power generation facilities. The most salient feature of an OSS is its dynamic nature. The number and kind of elements composing the system as well as the mode of control of those elements change frequently in response to the environment. The abstraction of control and the ease with which complex dynamic control behavior can be modeled and simulated is one of the important aspects of the paradigm. The framework for the Smart Object paradigm is the fusion of object-oriented design models with declarative knowledge representation and active inferencing from AI models. Additional defining concepts from data/knowledge models, semantic data models, active databases, and frame based systems, are added to the synthesis as justified by their contribution to the ability to naturally model OSS at a high level of abstraction. The model assists in declaratively representing domain data/knowledge and its structure, and task or process knowledge, in addition to modeling multilevel control and interobject coordination	,Control systems;Energy management;Environmental management;Knowledge representation;Management information systems;Manufacturing;Object oriented modeling;Power generation;Power system management;Power system modeling,active databases;deductive databases;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;object-oriented methodsAI models;Smart Object paradigm;active databases;active inferencing;complex dynamic control behavior;control abstraction;data/knowledge paradigm;declarative knowledge representation;declarative representation;frame based systems;information systems;interactive support;large complex operations environment management;large power generation facilities;manufacturing plants;military operations;object-oriented design models;operations support system design;operations support system modelling;process knowledge;semantic data models;task knowledge

We assess the bit-error-rate (BER) performance achieved when such filters are implemented in the system, and we compare the results to those achieved with the filter originally recommended for implementation in the system. Two alternatives to the original sixth-order Bessel-Butterworth were examined: a fifth order Butterworth with cascaded first-order phase equalizer and a sixth-order equiripple group delay filter. The former showed up to 1 dB gain in BER performance for the forward channel, and the latter showed up to 1 dB gain in the reverse channel	,Bit error rate;Chebyshev approximation;Delay;Digital filters;Frequency shift keying;Narrowband;Passband;Personal communication networks;RF signals;Wireless communication,Butterworth filters;cascade networks;delays;digital filters;digital radio;error statistics;mobile radio;personal communication networks1 dB;4 dB;BER performance;bit-error-rate performance;fifth order Butterworth filter;first-order phase equalizer;group-delay optimized IF filters;narrowband PCS;personal communications system;sixth-order equiripple group delay filter;two-way digital messaging							
1597	Effect of i-layer parameters on the performance of Si n+-i-n+ homojunction far-infrared detectors	Yuan, Y.; Perera, A.G.U.	Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	A unified formalism, including space-charge-limited (SCL) conduction, tunneling, and the multiple-image-force effect, is developed to perform a complete analysis of Si n+-i-n+ homojunction interfacial workfunction internal photoemission (HIWIP) FIR detectors. It is shown that due to the space-charge effect, the detector performance, such as cutoff wavelength (?c), quantum efficiency (?), dark current (Id), noise equivalent power (NEP), etc., is strongly influenced by the i-layer thickness (Wi ) and compensating acceptor concentration (Nai) in addition to the emitter layer parameters. As a result, the optimum operating conditions of detectors also depend on W and Nai. The background limited performance (BLIP) is evaluated, and a critical W i value is found for BLIP operation	,Astronomy;Dark current;Detectors;Diodes;Finite impulse response filter;Helium;Performance analysis;Photoelectricity;Physics;Tunneling,elemental semiconductors;infrared detectors;photodetectors;silicon;space-charge-limited conduction;tunnelling;work functionSCL conduction;Si;Si n+-i-n+ homojunction FIR detectors;background limited performance;compensating acceptor concentration;cutoff wavelength;dark current;detector performance;emitter layer parameters;far-infrared detectors;i-layer parameters;i-layer thickness;interfacial workfunction;internal photoemission;multiple-image-force effect;noise equivalent power;optimum operating conditions;quantum efficiency;space-charge-limited conduction;tunneling

Electronics Letters	20020806	By using step-graded Al compositions of epitaxial AlGaAs, we can form a tapered oxidation front due to the combination of rapid lateral oxidation in a higher AI content layer and slow transverse oxidation into adjacent lower Al content layers. A study of the oxidation behaviour of this epitaxial aperture layer demonstrates the feasibility of tapered dielectric apertures which have been predicted to provide much lower losses in vertical cavity lasers	laser cavity resonatorsAlGaAs;losses;oxidation behaviour;rapid lateral oxidation;slow transverse oxidation;tapered apertures;tapered dielectric apertures;vertical-cavity lasers							
1599	An implementation of a hybrid intelligent tool for distribution system fault diagnosis	Momoh, J.A.; Dias, L.G.; Laird, D.N.	Power Delivery, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The common fault in distribution systems due to line outages consists of single-line-to-ground (SLG) faults, with low or high fault impedance. The presence of arcing is commonplace in high impedance SLG faults. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques have been introduced for low/high impedance fault diagnosis in ungrounded distribution systems and high-impedance fault diagnosis in grounded distribution systems. So far no tool has been developed to identify, locate and classify faults on grounded and ungrounded systems. This paper describes an integrated package for fault diagnosis in either grounded or ungrounded distribution systems. It utilizes rule-based schemes as well as artificial neural networks (ANN) to detect, classify and locate faults. Its application on sample test data as well as field test data are reported in the paper	,Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Conductors;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Fault location;Impedance;Packaging;Testing,diagnostic expert systems;distribution networks;earthing;fault location;neural nets;power system analysis computingartificial intelligence techniques;artificial neural networks;computer simulation;distribution system fault diagnosis;fault classification;hybrid intelligent tool;rule-based schemes;single-line-to-ground faults							
1600	Robust decoupling of discrete systems using &Lscr;1 optimization	Choon Kiong Quek; Ai Poh Loh	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	We address a control design problem related to decoupling, namely robust decoupling. The idea of robust decoupling is defined and shown to be equivalent to robust performance of a Hadamard-weighted L1  performance measure. A necessary and sufficient condition to determine if a compensator satisfies robust performance of a Hadamard-weighted L1 performance measure in the presence of structured uncertainty is given. This condition can be used to determine if a compensator robustly decouples a plant. Finally, an iterative scheme for synthesizing a robust decoupling controller is discussed	,Control design;Convolution;Design optimization;Error correction;Error correction codes;Open loop systems;Robust control;Robust stability;Robustness;Sufficient conditions,compensation;control system synthesis;discrete time systems;iterative methods;optimisation;robust control&Lscr;1 optimization;Hadamard-weighted &Lscr;1 performance measure;compensator;control design problem;discrete systems;iterative scheme;necessary and sufficient condition;robust decoupling;structured uncertainty							
1601	Modeling Adaptive Autonomous Agents		Artificial Life:An Overview	20121008	One category of research in Artificial Life is concerned with modeling and building so-called adaptive autonomous agents, which are systems that inhabit a dynamic, unpredictable environment in which they try to satisfy a set of time-dependent goals or motivations. Agents are said to be adaptive if they improve their competence at dealing with these goals. based on experience. Autonomous agents constitute a new approach to the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is highly inspired by biology, in particular ethology, the study of animal behavior. Research in autonomous agents has brought about a new wave of excitement into the field of AI. This paper reflects on the state of the art of this new approach. It attempts to extract its main ideas, evaluates what contributions have been made so far, and identifies its current limitations and open problems.

Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to determine the quasi-stationary two-dimensional electromagnetic fields within rectangular boundaries. Amplitude and phase of magnetic vector potential have been calculated in an iron slot with an embedded current carrying conductor. A suitable fuzzy neural network (FNN) for scaling finite elements electromagnetic field calculations has been developed. FNN has been trained, using finite elements calculations within rectangular boundaries. Then, FNN has been used to calculate the field in a new geometry differing significantly from the geometries used for training. It was concluded that FNN may be used to scale results from one geometry to another with negligible errors	,Artificial intelligence;Conductors;Current density;Electromagnetic fields;Finite element methods;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Geometry;Power system stability,electromagnetic field theory;finite element analysis;fuzzy neural netsartificial intelligence;embedded current carrying conductor;finite element solution scaling;fuzzy logic;fuzzy neural network;iron slot;magnetic vector potential;quasi-stationary two-dimensional electromagnetic field;rectangular boundary;training							
1605	Understanding the nature of predatory pricing in large-scale market economy with genetic algorithms	Shuheng, Chen; Chih-chi, Ni; Shan, Feng	Systems Engineering and Electronics, Journal of	20120117	In this paper the nature of predatory pricing is analyzed with genetic algorithms. It is found that, even under the same payoff structure, the results of the co-evolution of weak monopolists and entrants are sensitive to the representation of the decision-making process. Two representations are studied in this paper. One is the action-based representation and the other the strategy-based representation. The former is to represent a naive mind and the latter is to capture a sophisticated mind. For the action-based representation, the convergence results are easily obtained and predatory pricing is only temporary in all simulations. However, for the strategy-based representation, predatory pricing is not a rare phenomenon and its appearance is cyclical but not regular. Therefore, the snowball effect of a little craziness observed in the experimental game theory wins its support from this representation. Furthermore, the nature of predatory pricing has something to do with the evolution of the sophisticated rather than the naive minds.

IEEE Expert	20020806	Gas turbines are critical to the operation of most industrial plants, and their associated maintenance costs can be extremely high. To reduce those costs and increase the availability of their gas turbines, plant operators have for many years relied on routine preventative maintenance-routinely checking and solving small problems before they grow into major ones. Recently, however, the power industry has moved sharply toward condition-based maintenance and monitoring. In this approach, intelligent computerized systems monitor gas turbines to establish maintenance needs based on the turbine's condition rather than on a fixed number of operating hours. By integrating several AI technologies-including qualitative model-based reasoning-the Tiger system significantly cuts costs and improves performance by using control-system information to perform condition monitoring for gas-turbine engines	,Artificial intelligence;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Costs;Industrial plants;Intelligent systems;Power industry;Power system modeling;Preventive maintenance;Turbines,common-sense reasoning;computerised monitoring;diagnostic reasoning;electric machine analysis computing;gas turbines;industrial plants;maintenance engineering;mechanical engineering computing;model-based reasoningAI technologies;CA-EN;Exxon Fife ethylene plant;IxTeT;Kheops;Tiger system;availability;condition-based maintenance;control-system information;gas-turbine condition monitoring;gas-turbine engines;industrial plants;intelligent computerized systems;maintenance costs;performance;qualitative model-based diagnosis;routine preventative maintenance

IEEE Expert	20020806	Reflects on the evolution of scientists' understanding of evolution as a function of the kinds of modeling tools they create. Over the years, models of the evolution of cognition have progressed from those in which the environment is assumed to be static to models in which the environment changes, but only in terms of physical characteristics, to models in which the environment changes according to the influences of competitors that have perceptual and cognitive abilities. The latter models are called psychological selection models, and the authors argue that sophisticated models which assume adaptation based on complex interactions with other organisms might be useful for AI researchers who are developing artificial models of cognitive complexity	,Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Cognition;Computational modeling;Cultural differences;Evolution (biology);Humans;Machine learning;Organisms;Psychology,adaptive systems;cognitive systems;competitive algorithms;genetic algorithmsadaptation;changing environment;cognition;cognitive abilities;cognitive complexity;cognitive evolution;competitors;complex interactions;perceptual abilities;physical characteristics;psychological selection models;static environment

1620	Recombination kinetics of excess carriers in semiconductor quantum wells	Jin, Shirong; Aizhen Li	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	A theoretical investigation of radiative and nonradiative recombination of excess carriers in a semiconductor quantum well (QW), which takes into account the exciton screening effect, is presented. The analytical formula of photoluminescence (PL) lifetime and efficiency of a QW are obtained. Calculations for the case of GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells show that the variation of PL lifetime and efficiency with temperature is strongly related to material characteristics as well as the detailed growth techniques. When the ratio of the radiative recombination rate to the nonradiative recombination rate is less than unity, there is no characteristic temperature. In the regime of low excitation intensity, the increase of the majority carrier density is helpful to enhance the formation of the electron-hole pairs into excitons. Under higher excitations, the exciton population factor and the PL efficiency increases with increasing excitation intensity. The exciton screening effect depends, in addition to excitation intensity, upon background carrier density. ﾩ 1997 American Institute of Physics.	carrier density;excitons;nonradiative transitions;photoluminescence;semiconductor quantum wells;surface recombination6865+g;7135-y;7320Dx;7325+i;7340Kp;7340Lq;7350Gr;7855Cr;7866Fd;8530Vw,

1622	Electrostatic discharge sensitivity of giant magnetoresistive recording heads	Wallash, Albert J.; Kim, Young K.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	In this article electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage to giant magnetoresistive (GMR) recording heads is studied for the first time. The ESD failure threshold was measured using an extremely short duration (1 ns) metal contact ESD transient. The failure energy required to melt the GMR recording head was 2.3 nJ, about half of the 5 nJ of energy needed to melt a conventional anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) head design. Scanning electron microscope scans of ESD damaged AMR and GMR heads show localized melting of the sensors. It is concluded that recording heads with GMR sensors, planned for use in the near future, will have significantly lower ESD failure thresholds than AMR recording heads in use today. Finally, scaling arguments show that an AMR head design with the same reduced cross-sectional area of the GMR head has a comparable ESD failure threshold. ﾩ 1997 American Institute of Physics.	electrostatic discharge;giant magnetoresistance;magnetic heads;magnetic recording7350Jt;7550Ss;7570Pa;8570Kh;8570Li,							
1623	A model for advanced in-house industrial training: a case study on intelligent system technology transfer using a project-oriented approach	da Mota Tenorio, M.F.; Pereira Maia, A.C.; Grant-Tenorio, A.E.	Education, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETROBRAS) in conjunction with Synergetics Science and Technology Inc. has developed a comprehensive graduate level educational program in intelligent system design technology. The primary goals of this program are: training professionals to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NN) techniques to managerial and technological problem solving, and to do this in a manner that is both time- and cost-effective. This particular program has been centered around two distinct areas of specialization: symbolic AI and the connectionist approach (NNs). The AI section of the course is titled CAVIAR. The NN section of the course is titled CERN. Short courses and seminars were also part of the program. For this paper, our focus has been to deal with the special needs of graduate-level education in large companies as part of employee professional training. We also explore the nuances of, and the various needs associated with teaching intelligent system design technologies to such a diverse group, as is found in large companies like PETROBRAS. This paper also describes the needs that led to the development of such a broad-based program, the goals and structures of the various courses, the student profiles, educational facilities (libraries and computer laboratories), and the lessons learned.

1626	Logic Programming for Processing Natural Language		Logic Programming:The 1997 International Symposium	20120924	We uncover a natural alliance between natural language and logic programming, which was apparent in the beginnings of the latter and is becoming again apparent in a more mature state-of-the-art way. We first present a short historic overview, from the origins of Prolog as a ﾓman-machineﾔ system for communicating in natural language, to the present promise, implicit in recent developments, that natural language for controlling various AI applications may not be too far away after all. We then briefly describe three important families of linguistically principled approaches to natural language processing: unification-based (also known as constraint-based), logico-mathematical, and principles-and-parameters. We stress common points between the areas of natural language processing through logic programming and linguistic theory, such as the ideas of infer-encing, unification and constraints. We also note cross-fertilizations among these fields, such as memoization, which was born from David D. H. Warren's observation that the Earley algorithm ideas about parsing should be transfered into logic programming proper; as well as with other fields (e.g. connections with parametric L-systems, which were developed for visual models of plant development and constitute an interesting parallel grammar paradigm; Datalog grammars, inspired by database theory, and with interesting termination properties). Among the latest developments, we describe in some more detail Assumption Grammars, which we believe to be the best compromise to date between expressive and linguistic power. These are basically Definite Clause Grammars, augmented with linear and intuitionistic implication, and which handle multiple streams (as in Peter Van Roig's Extended Definite Clause Grammars, but without the need of a preprocessing technique). We then show how Assumption Grammars are useful for typical hard problems in natural language processing: anaphora, coordination, co-specification, free word order. We also show two recent results which were surprising to us, namely: a) Assumption grammars allow a direct and efficient implementation of link grammars -a context-free like formalism developed independently from logic grammars; and b) they offer the flexibility of switching between data-driven or goal-driven reasoning, at no overhead in terms of either syntax or implementation. Next, we discuss several interesting applications, most of them briefly but the last one in some detail: concept-based retrieval through natural language, driving robots through Natural Language, error diagnosis and repair, machine translation, language front ends to knowledge based systems, and controlling virtual worlds through natural language. We argue that we can exploit the characteristics of virtual worlds and of Assumption Grammars to develop untraditional but extremely expressive natural language analysers (with complete non-determinism, partial formula evaluation through consulting world knowledge gleaned from the net, easy extensibility both in terms of language coverage and of transfer into other natural languages), and that these new techniques might soon lead to the direct use of some form of controlled language input, together with speech recognition, as a language front end to many AI applications, with Prolog as an invisible mediator.

1630	Thermoelectronic breakdown with pressure and space charge effects in polyethylene	Zebouchi, N.; Hoang, T.G.; Ai, Bui	Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	The electrical breakdown of low density polyethylene films 100 ?m thick was investigated experimentally and theoretically under high hydrostatic pressure (1 to 500 bar) at temperatures of 20, 70, and 90 ﾰC. The theoretical analysis was based on combining the two basic mechanisms of thermal and electronic breakdowns by introducing a new parameter, pressure. This model mainly takes into account the transient current using the hopping transport phenomenon and local electric field distortion due to the presence of space charges in the material. The results of simulation show good agreement with experiments compared to our previous works on the modeling of electrical breakdown in which the effect of space charges was neglected. ﾩ 1997 American Institute of Physics.	dielectric thin films;electric breakdown;high-pressure effects;hopping conduction;polymer films;space charge;thermoelectricity6250+p;7220Fr;7220Pa;7361Ph;7722Jp;7755+f,

Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	In this paper the relationship between state feedback control laws and full information control laws, i.e. control laws which make explicit use of the disturbance signals, is discussed in the framework of nonlinear singular H? control. In particular, it is shown that any (polynomial) full information control law can always be approximated by a state feedback control law, provided that a certain (arbitrarily small) amount of performance is sacrificed. Moreover, the obtained result is used to give alternative proofs and generalizations to some existing results in the area of global disturbance attenuation for nonlinear systems and to establish some new and interesting results regarding the problem of approximate model matching	,Attenuation;Automatic control;Control systems;Equations;Nonlinear systems;Optimal control;Particle measurements;Polynomials;Regulators;State feedback,H? control;asymptotic stability;closed loop systems;nonlinear control systems;state feedbackH? control;almost model matching;asymptotic stability;global disturbance attenuation;nonlinear singular control;nonlinear systems;state feedback

1636	Do agents need understanding?	Haase, K.	IEEE Expert	20020806	There are several important ideas and questions that arise within AI work on agents. I address one of these questions by asking how much ﾓhuman-likeﾔ understanding is necessary for a useful agent. One of the lessons of the new wave of AI research in the late 1980s and early 1990s was a greater appreciation for the artifacts introduced by a-priori assumptions about the description of problems. Systems of surprising effectiveness, flexibility and simplicity could solve apparently complicated problems by dropping the assumptions about identity, reference and generality imported from their common-sense linguistic formulation. By using encodings or representations which are simultaneously more specialized in some ways (by being task-specific) and more general in other ways (by their systemic regard for embeddedness as a design constraint), these systems introduced a different way of thinking about representation and intelligence. The intellectual contribution of the idea of an intelligent agent lies in a similar attitude toward the tasks of helping us deal with the mass of information and responsibilities around us	,Cleaning;Clocks;Humans;Laboratories;Law;Legal factors;Page description languages;Particle measurements;Predictive models;Solids,cognitive systems;knowledge representation;problem solving;software agentsa-priori assumptions;artificial intelligence;common-sense linguistic formulation;design constraint;embeddedness;encodings;generality;human-like understanding;identity;intelligent agents;problem description;problem solving;reference;representations;task-specificity

1647	The brick wall: NP completeness	Franco, J.	Potentials, IEEE	20020806	For over 40 years, artificial intelligence (AI) has not fulfilled its promise of truly intelligent machines for general use. As early as the 1950s and 1960s, scientists developed computational models of intelligence. They then excitedly coded these models into the best computers of the day. At first the scientists were puzzled by the machines' inability to produce reasoned output. Bewilderment became frustration when they realized they had banged into an unforeseen brick wall. This wall had stopped them in their tracks and continues to do so today. AI also has stymied scientists and engineers in other fields such as operations research (the field concerned with determining efficient manufacturing and scheduling protocols), VLSI chip design and testing, and database management. The brick wall exists because many combinatorial problems that are fundamentally important are NP complete. (NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time.) We illustrate the problem NP completeness causes with an example taken from manufacturing. A general purpose welding device is to be used on an assembly line. It will make numerous welds at predetermined positions on a particular kind of part. The positions will be welded in a specific sequence called a schedule. This schedule is programmed into the welder before a ﾓrunﾔ	,Artificial intelligence;Computational and artificial intelligence;Computational modeling;Data engineering;Design engineering;Job shop scheduling;Machine intelligence;Manufacturing;Operations research;Welding,artificial intelligence;assembling;computational complexity;production control;scheduling;weldingAI;NP complete;NP completeness;artificial intelligence;assembly line;combinatorial problems;general purpose welding device;intelligent machines;manufacturing;nondeterministic polynomial time;operations research;scheduling protocols							
1648	Automatic generation of intelligent agent programs	Spector, L.	IEEE Expert	20020806	One cause for excitement about agent oriented AI is the belief that it is easier to write programs for many narrow, autonomous systems than for fewer, broader, user-driven systems. A related cause for excitement is the primary message of these comments: it is also easier to automatically generate agent programs. The artificial life, machine learning, and automatic programming literature already describes many experiments in which systems with agent-like properties have been automatically generated. Although most of the previously generated systems have been too simple to perform helpful tasks for actual users, recent advances suggest that useful intelligent agents will soon be within reach of these techniques.

Computer	20020806	Too often, software developers follow inefficient methods and procedures. The Personal Software Process, developed by Watts Humphrey at the Software Engineering Institute, provides software engineers with a methodology for consistently and efficiently developing high quality products. The value of PSP has been shown in three case studies-three industrial software groups have used PSP and have collected data to show its effectiveness. They are: Advanced Information Services, Inc., Motorola Paging Products Group, and Union Switch and Signal Inc. Each has trained several groups of engineers and measured the results of several projects that used PSP methods. In all cases, the projects were part of the companies' normal operations and not designed for this study. The three companies offered a variety of situations useful for demonstrating the versatility of PSP. The projects at Motorola and US&S involved software maintenance and enhancement, while those at AIS involved new product development and enhancement.

1652	Hybrid Probabilistic Programs		Logic Programming:The 14th International Conference	20120924	The precise probability of a compound event (e.g. e1 ? e2,e1 ? e2) depends upon the known relationships (e.g. independence, mutual exclusion, ignorance of any relationship, etc.) between the primitive events that constitute the compound event. To date, most research on probabilistic logic programming [12, 11, 13, 14, 15] has assumed that we are ignorant of the relationship between primitive events. Likewise, most research in AI (e.g. Bayesian approaches) have assumed that primitive events are independent. In this paper, we propose a hybrid probabilistic logic programming language in which the user can explicitly associate, with any given probabilistic strategy, a conjunction and disjunction operator, and then write programs using these operators. We describe the syntax of hybrid probabilistic programs, and develop a model theory, fixpoint theory, and proof theory for such programs.								
1653	The Internet, intranets, and the AI renaissance	O'Leary, D.E.	Computer	20020806	Virtually cost-free publication on the World Wide Web has led to information overload. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its roots in knowledge representation, is experiencing a renaissance as new tools emerge to make the Web more tractable. Why do these Internet-based applications herald an AI renaissance? AI has come to play a crucial role in Information Age retrieval strategies. Internet-based applications can exploit a wide range of AI developments. In this survey, we look at examples of the following AI technologies: natural language processing (concept-based Internet searching); machine-learning (WebWatcher); heuristic rules for establishing preference (Letizia); rule-based/heuristic natural language processing (ContactFinder, FAQFinder, Globenet); and neural networks (Autonomy). This isn't AI for AI's sake-this renaissance is not one of stand-alone AI applications. Unlike first-generation AI applications, AI can now be embedded in heterogeneous networked computing environments and used for searching, retrieval and analysis of previously unimaginable quantities of data. Because the wealth of data makes direct human analysis impossible, AI-based support has become necessary to help users fully exploit that information. Our increasingly competitive and technology-driven world has reduced the time available to us for decision-making.

1654	AI coming of age: NASA uses AI for autonomous space exploration	Hedberg, S.	IEEE Expert	20020806	At the end of the 20th Century, many organizations are rethinking the way they do business and are retooling with the ever-moving target of ﾓnew technologiesﾔ. NASA is no exception. To reduce the cost of space-exploration missions while increasing their number, NASA began the revolutionary New Millennium Program (NMP) in early 1995. At the NMP's center is a push for self-guiding and self-regulating spacecraft. This will change the ground-control staff requirements from the hundreds required now for a major planetary science mission to a mere handful. The vision is to be able to ﾓfire and forgetﾔ a whole series of missions that will go about their business of exploring, contacting home only when they find something of scientific interest or need help.

1655	Standardized ESD test for magnetoresistive recording heads	Wallash, Albert J.	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	A methodology and apparatus are described for completely characterizing the electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitivity of magnetoresistive (MR) recording heads. ESD testing of MR heads from six vendors was performed and a ﾓHuman Body Modelﾔ (HBM) failure voltage as low as 85 V was measured. Air gap breakdown voltages ranging from 400 V to 1100 V were also found. Two new findings were MR sensor damage when ESD pulses were injected into non-MR pins and corona damage. SEM failure analysis after ESD testing showed melting, pitting, and corona damage of the recording head structure. It is concluded that the MR/ESD tester is useful in studying the electrostatic properties of MR recording heads	,Corona;Disk recording;Electrostatic discharge;Electrostatic measurements;Low voltage;Magnetic heads;Magnetic sensors;Magnetoresistance;Performance evaluation;Testing,corona;electrostatic discharge;failure analysis;magnetic heads;magnetoresistive devices;scanning electron microscopy400 to 1100 V;85 V;SEM failure analysis;air gap breakdown voltages;corona damage;electrostatic discharge;failure voltage;human body model;magnetoresistive recording heads;melting;pitting;sensor damage;standardized ESD test							
1656	Default logic as a query language	Cadoli, M.; Eiter, T.; Gottlob, G.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Research in nonmonotonic reasoning has focused largely on the idea of representing knowledge about the world via rules that are generally true but can be defeated. Even if relational databases are nowadays the main tool for storing very large sets of data, the approach of using nonmonotonic AI formalisms as relational database query languages has been investigated to a much smaller extent. In this work, we propose a novel application of Reiter's default logic by introducing a default query language (DQL) for finite relational databases, which is based on default rules. The main result of this paper is that DQL is as expressive as SO?? the existential-universal fragment of second-order logic. This result is not only of theoretical importance: We exhibit queries-which are useful in practice-that can be expressed with DQL and cannot with other query languages based on nonmonotonic logics such as DATALOG with negation under the stable model semantics. In particular, we show that DQL is well-suited for diagnostic reasoning	,Artificial intelligence;Birds;Computational complexity;Database languages;Information retrieval;Knowledge representation;Logic;Nuclear magnetic resonance;Relational databases,formal logic;nonmonotonic reasoning;query languages;relational databasesdefault logic;default query language;diagnostic reasoning;finite relational databases;nonmonotonic logics;nonmonotonic reasoning;query language;relational database query languages;second-order logic;stable model semantics							
1657	Transaction Logic: An Introduction		Logic Programming:The 1997 International Symposium	20120924	The status of update operators in logic programming, such as assert and retract, has been a sore spot from the very inception of Prolog. Unlike much of the language, the update operators persistently defied the logical semantics, and their non-backtrackable nature was in stark contradiction with Prolog's operational semantics. The result of this unsatisfactory state of affairs is that Prolog programs that rely on backtracking through assert and retract axe notoriously hard to debug and maintain. This theoretical weakness becomes even more apparent when declarative programming tries to take a bite out of the object-oriented pie, where state-changing methods are commonplace. Although it is not hard to hack up backtrackable updates in Prolog and the technique for doing so has been known for a long time, the logic behind this such updates remained unclear. Unclear, that is, until Transaction Logic came along. Transaction Logic [7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 1, 3] is a conservative extension of classical predicate calculus. It has a natural model theory, a sound and complete proof theory and, unlike many other logics, it allows users to program state-changing actions by combining simple actions into complex ones. The semantics of Transaction Logic leads naturally to features whose amalgamation in a single logic has proved elusive in the past. Apart from com-posable, ﾓbacktrackable updates,ﾔ these features include non-deterministic actions, dynamic constraints on execution, tentative (non-committed) execution, concurrent and communicating processes, and more. Transaction Logic holds promise as a logical model of hitherto non-logical phenomena, including so-called procedural knowledge in AI, active databases, and the behavior of object-oriented databases, especially methods with side effects. This tutorial is intended as an introduction to Transaction Logic, which will provide a glimpse into the model theory, the proof theory, and some of the applications of the logic.								
1658	The EDRC and design: a deeper understanding	Siewiorek, D.P.; Fenves, S.J.; Demes, G.H.	IEEE Expert	20020806	Since its inception in 1986, Carnegie Mellon University's Engineering Design Research Center (EDRC), sponsored by the National Science Foundation, has worked to achieve a broader and deeper understanding of design. By broader, we mean expanding from an artifact's detailed physical design to its full life cycle (from conception to disposal); by deeper, we mean providing a science base for comprehending the design process itself so that computer based methods and tools can better support it. This would provide conceptual bases and computational support to aid US industry in producing superior products more quickly and at lower cost. The EDRC's research emphasizes: understanding design's qualitative aspects to the same extent that the quantitative, algorithmic aspects have been addressed in the past; creating an interdisciplinary environment where pursuing innovation and understanding of the design process is a major goal; and training students in those aspects of design that currently cannot be automated. The EDRC's research accomplishments can be described in terms of three phases: applying cognitive science and computer science techniques and tools to engineering design problems; creating integrated, computational tool environments for particular domains; and supplying comprehensive, team-supportive environments where researchers can design and fabricate artifacts. Throughout all three phases, it was discovered that AI design techniques apply to synthesis tools and to environments that integrate tool and design collaboration	,Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Cognitive science;Computer industry;Computer science;Costs;Design engineering;Physics computing;Process design;Technological innovation,cognitive systems;computer aided engineering;design engineering;intelligent design assistants;research initiativesAI design techniques;Carnegie Mellon University;Engineering Design Research Center;US industry;algorithmic aspects;cognitive science;computational support;computer based methods;computer science techniques;conceptual bases;design collaboration;design process;engineering design problems;innovation;integrated computational tool environments;interdisciplinary environment;life cycle;physical design;qualitative aspects;synthesis tools;team-supportive environments;training

1660	Representing Priorities in Logic Programs		Logic Programming:Proceedings of the 1996 Joint International Conference and Symposium on Logic Programming	20120924	Reasoning with priorities is a central topic in knowledge representation. A number of techniques for prioritized reasoning have been developed in the field of AI, but existing logic programming lacks the mechanism of explicit representation of priorities in a program. In this paper, we introduce a framework for representing priorities in logic programming. Prioritized logic programmimg represents preference knowledge more naturally than stratified programs, and is used to reduce non-determinism in logic programming. Moreover, it can realize various forms of commonsense reasoning such as abduction, default reasoning, and prioritized circumscription. The proposed framework increases the expressive power of logic programming and exploits new applications in knowledge representation.								
1661	Electron beam evaporation broad beam metal ion source for material modifications	Feng, Y.C.; Li, X.G.; Yang, S.T.	Review of Scientific Instruments	20090618	This paper describes a new type of electron beam evaporation intense beam current broad beam metal ion source. In this ion source, a focusing electron beam is used to bombard and vaporize the metal and other solid elements within the same chamber where the metal and solid element atoms are ionized by arc discharge. It can operate with gaseous and solid elements. Both pure or mixed ions with single or multiple charge states can also be extracted from this source. The performance and the characteristics of this source have tested. Ion beams of a series of elements, which include C, W, Ta, Mo, Cr, Ti, B, Cu, Ni, AI, Ar, N, etc., have been extracted, and the highest beam current is up to 90 mA. By using this ion beam bombardment, a good mixture between substrate and film was observed. Deposition rates as high as 25 �/s for Mo, 30 �/s for Ti, and 80 �/s for C have been obtained. The structure of the ion source and the experimental results will be presented in this paper. � 1996 American Institute of Physics.

IEEE Expert	20020806	Archon provides a software framework that assists interaction between the subcomponents of a distributed AI application, and a design methodology that helps structure these interactions. The Archon project has been applied to several real world industrial applications. Two of these applications, electricity transportation management and particle accelerator control, have run online in the organizations for which they were developed-Iberdrola, a Spanish electric utility, and the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN). Archon's problem solving entities are called agents; they can control their own problem solving and interact with other community members. The interactions typically involve agents cooperating and communicating with one another to enhance their individual problem solving and to better solve the overall application problem.

Control Systems, IEEE	20020806	In this article we review the growth and development of control engineering, leading to modern adaptive methods and finally to autonomous intelligent control. Although the use of feedback control can be traced back to ancient and medieval times, it is really during the 20th century that control engineering has become a recognized discipline. Well-established methods to model and control plants with linear characteristics and unchanging parameters are already in existence. Nonlinear plants with time-varying internal parameters are more challenging and the so-called ﾓadaptiveﾔ methods have been developed to address this issue. There are controllers that can ﾓlearnﾔ by using AI techniques such as expert systems, genetic algorithms, neural networks, etc. These paradigms have evolved mostly from studying biological learning processes	,Adaptive control;Artificial intelligence;Control engineering;Control systems;Expert systems;Feedback control;Genetic algorithms;Intelligent control;Neural networks;Programmable control,adaptive control;control engineering;intelligent control;learning (artificial intelligence);neurocontrollers;reviewsAI techniques;adaptive methods;autonomous intelligent methods;biological learning processes;control engineering;expert systems;feedback control;genetic algorithms;neural networks;nonlinear plants;time-varying internal parameters							
1666	An architecture for adaptive intelligent systems		Computational Theories of Interaction and Agency	20120924	Our goal is to understand and build comprehensive agents that function effectively in challenging niches. In particular, we identify a class of niches to be occupied by ﾓadaptive intelligent systems (AISs)ﾔ In contrast with niches occupied by typical AI agents, AIS niches present situations that vary dynamically along several key dimensions: different combinations of required tasks, different configurations of available resources, contextual conditions ranging from benign to stressful, and different performance criteria. We present a small class hierarchy of AIS niches that exhibit these dimensions of variability and describe a particular AIS niche, ICU (intensive care unit) patient monitoring, which we use for illustration throughout the paper. To function effectively throughout the range of situations presented by an AIS niche, an agent must be highly adaptive. In contrast with the rather stereotypic behavior of typical AI agents, an AIS must adapt several key aspects of its behavior to its dynamic situation: its perceptual strategy, its control mode, its choices of reasoning tasks to perform, its choices of reasoning methods for performing chosen tasks; and its meta-control strategy for global coordination of all its behavior. We have designed and implemented an agent architecture that supports all of these different kinds of adaptation by exploiting a single underlying theoretical concept: An agent dynamically constructs explicit control plans to guide its choices among situation-triggered behaviors. The architecture has been used to build experimental agents for several AIS niches. We illustrate the architecture and its support for adaptation with examples from Guardian, an experimental agent for ICU monitoring.

Rutherford backscattering spectrometry was used to determine the film thickness and composition. The x-ray diffraction patterns of LaNiO3 films indicated that the lowest temperature for crystallization is about 530 �C. The measurement of resistivity as a function of annealing temperatures showed that the good metallic conductive LaNiO3 films could be obtained at 550 �C. The films with the lowest resistivity (4.0�10-4 ? cm) were obtained on quartz by annealing in oxygen at 700 �C. � 1996 American Institute of Physics.

1672	Some Comments on Evolutionary Algorithm Theory	Salomon, R	Evolutionary Computation	20140519	The development of a sound theory that predicts and verifies existing evolutionary algorithms (EA) is one of the most important research issues in the field today. In mathematical proofs, the assumption of spherical symmetry is probably one of the most widely used simplifications. This paper discusses the extent to which spherical symmetry is appropriate for certain EAs. It turns out that spherical symmetry leads to simplifications in (self-adaptive) EAs but seems inappropriate for certain genetic algorithm variants, since small mutation rates bias a search algorithm toward the coordinate axes. This paper also argues that current test suites are weak in that they do not provide problems with significant epistasis that describes the interaction between different parameters. Consequently, when using an empirical test for pushing existing theory beyond its limits, benchmark functions should include more epistatic interaction or at least should use coordinate rotations.

1673	The role of AI in digital libraries	Koller, D.; Shoham, Y.; Wellman, M.P.; Durfee, E.H.; Birmingham, W.P.; Carbonell, J.	IEEE Expert	20020806	The World Wide Web's growing popularity is changing the nature of libraries. Digital libraries offer a huge range of multimedia information-everything from movies, speeches, images, and photos to sounds, text, and beyond. The amount of on-line material is exploding, and the infrastructure for locating and accessing material improves almost daily. With so much and such a wide variety of information available, the problem is changing from simply locating related information to locating the most relevant information efficiently and cost effectively. In building the next generation of digital libraries, artificial intelligence will play several important roles. First, the multimedia nature of digital libraries will require moving beyond simple keyword lookup of information to much more advanced document-processing capabilities in which the system analyzes the content through text analysis, image processing, and speech recognition. Second, the availability of such a huge amount of information will require advances in the infrastructure for organizing and accessing information. A promising approach to this problem is the development of information agents. These agents can provide a variety of services-such as searching, retrieving, filtering, and negotiating-that reduce the burden on the information user or provider.

Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part A: Systems and Humans, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	This article presents an approach to embedding expert systems within an object oriented simulation environment. The basic idea is to create classes of expert system models that can be interfaced with other model classes. An expert system shell is developed within a knowledge-based design and simulation environment which combines artificial intelligence and systems modeling concepts. In the given framework, interruptible and distributed expert systems can be defined as components of simulations models. This facilitates simulation modeling of knowledge-based controls for flexible manufacturing and many other autonomous intelligent systems. Moreover, the structure of a system can be specified using a recursive system entity structure (SES) and unfolded to generate a family of hierarchical structures using an extension of SES pruning called recursive pruning. This recursive generation of hierarchical structures is especially appropriate for design of multilevel flexible factories.

1679	The challenge of artificial intelligence	Reddy, R.	Computer	20020806	Artificial intelligence (AI) is a relatively young discipline, yet it has already led to general-purpose problem-solving methods and novel applications. Ultimately, AI's goals of creating models and mechanisms of intelligent action can be realized only in the broader context of computer science. Creating mechanisms for sharing of knowledge, knowhow, and literacy is the challenge. The great Chinese philosopher Kuan-Tzu once said: ﾓIf you give a fish to a man, you will feed him for a day. If you give him a fishing rod, you will feed him for life.ﾔ We can go one step further: If we can provide him with the knowledge and the know-how for making that fishing rod, we can feed the whole village.

The 1sﾖ3p photothermal ionization transitions of the hydrogenic donors are observed even at zero magnetic field. The photoconductivity transition related to the LO phonon is observed and discussed. Furthermore, the photothermal ionization transitions arising from different chemical donors are also clearly resolved in a magnetic field.

Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	Photoluminescence measurements have been performed on a In0.82Ga0.18As/In0.52Al0.48As strained double quantum wells with narrow well widths of 38 and 48 �. The band offset ratio Qc in this narrow quantum well structures was found to be 0.70�0.01. Based on a steady-state photoluminescence model, the temperature and laser excitation dependences of the luminescence intensity allow us to conclude that the thermal quenching of luminescence is controlled by the quantum transport of the photogenerated carriers for temperature below 125 K, while the dominant luminescence quenching mechanism above 150 K is a thermally activated detrapping of carriers from the wells into barriers, followed by nonradiative recombination in the barriers. � 1996 American Institute of Physics.

1687	Low observable target motion analysis using amplitude information	Kirubarajan, T.; Bar-Shalom, Y.	Aerospace and Electronic Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	In conventional passive and active sonar system, target amplitude information (AI) at the output of the signal processor is used only to declare detections and provide measurements. We show that the AI can be used in passive sonar system, with or without frequency measurements, in the estimation process itself to enhance the performance in the presence of clutter where the target-originated measurements cannot be identified with certainty, i.e., for ﾓlow observableﾔ or ﾓdimﾔ (low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) targets. A probabilistic data association (PDA) based maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for target motion analysis (TMA) that uses amplitude information is derived. A track formation algorithm and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the presence of false measurements, which is met by the estimator even under low SNR conditions, are also given. The CRLB is met by the proposed estimator even at 6 dB in a cell (which corresponds to 0 dB for 1 Hz bandwidth in the case of a 0.25 Hz frequency cell) whereas the estimator without AI works only down to 9 dB. Results demonstrate improved accuracy and superior global convergence when compared with the estimator without AI. The same methodology can be used for bistatic radar	,Artificial intelligence;Clutter;Frequency estimation;Frequency measurement;Maximum likelihood estimation;Motion analysis;Signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;Sonar detection;Sonar measurements,maximum likelihood estimation;object detection;observability;radar clutter;sonar tracking;target tracking1 Hz;Cramer-Rao lower bound;amplitude information;bistatic radar;clutter;estimation process;global convergence;maximum likelihood estimator;observable target motion analysis;passive sonar system;probabilistic data association;signal-to-noise ratio;target amplitude information;track formation algorithm

X-ray ?ﾖ2? scans, x-ray ? scans, and the Rutherford backscattering channeling technique were used to determine the degree of crystallinity of the films.

1695	PRIAM: polite rescheduler for intelligent automated manufacturing	Tsukada, T.K.; Shin, K.G.	Robotics and Automation, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	This paper considers the problem of rescheduling in a decentralized manufacturing system. Flexible manufacturing systems must be able to respond to unexpected disruptions; including schedule disruptions. However, when a cell controller in a decentralized system responds to a disruption, it may disrupt some other cells, because the actions taken at one cell may have some consequence at another cells. In the approach we propose, a controller at a disrupted cell tries to respond in a way which is likely to be least disruptive to other cells, through negotiation with controllers at other cells. This approach, which we call ﾓpolite replanningﾔ, has the advantage of retaining much of the original distributed plan, while avoiding wide propagation of the disruption through the rest of the system. We apply this concept to the domain of distributed factory rescheduling, and describe PRIAM (polite rescheduler for intelligent automated manufacturing), a ﾓpoliteﾔ rescheduling architecture which is currently under development. Simulation results show that the use of negotiation in ﾓpoliteﾔ rescheduling prevents the wide propagation of disruption from an initial local disruption	,Automatic control;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Control systems;Flexible manufacturing systems;Job shop scheduling;Manufacturing automation;Manufacturing systems;Production facilities;Pulp manufacturing,computer aided production planning;distributed control;flexible manufacturing systems;intelligent control;production control;schedulingPRIAM architecture;decentralized manufacturing system;distributed AI;distributed factory rescheduling;flexible manufacturing systems;formal model;intelligent automated manufacturing;local disruption;polite replanning;polite rescheduler

The Archon software framework integrated seven heterogeneous agents-some preexisting systems and some custom built-into a functional real world application. This DAI approach provides economy, robustness, reliability and a natural representation of the domain. The article discusses the use of Archon by Iberdrola, a Spanish electric utility. To ensure that Iberdrola's transport network remains within the desired safety and economical constraints, Iberdrola uses a sophisticated data acquisition system called Scada (supervisory control and data acquisition) and several conventional application programs that help the operator (the control engineer) to analyze it (these programs are primarily designed for normal operating conditions). Whenever an unexpected event occurs, the Scada system automatically sends hundreds of alarms to the control room. Under these circumstances, the operator must rely on experiential knowledge to analyze the information, diagnose the situation, and take appropriate remedial actions to return the network to a safe state. To reduce the operators' cognitive load in such circumstances, and to help them make better decisions faster, Iberdrola decided to develop several decision support systems. They then interconnected these systems and subsequently extended them using Archon distributed AI technology.	,Application software;Automatic control;Control systems;Data engineering;Energy management;Power industry;Robustness;SCADA systems;Safety;Transportation,cooperative systems;decision support systems;distributed processing;electricity supply industry;power engineering computing;power system control;software agents;user interfacesArchon distributed AI technology;Archon software framework;DAI approach;Iberdrola;Scada;Spanish electric utility;data acquisition system;decision support systems;economical constraints;electricity transportation management;functional real world application;heterogeneous agents;transport network;unexpected event

1700	How to Shift Bias: Lessons from the Baldwin Effect	Turney, P	Evolutionary Computation	20140519	An inductive learning algorithm takes a set of data as input and generates a hypothesis as output. A set of data is typically consistent with an infinite number of hypotheses; therefore, there must be factors other than the data that determine the output of the learning algorithm. In machine learning, these other factors are called the bias of the learner. Classical learning algorithms have a fixed bias, implicit in their design. Recently developed learning algorithms dynamically adjust their bias as they search for a hypothesis. Algorithms that shift bias in this manner are not as well understood as classical algorithms. In this paper, we show that the Baldwin effect has implications for the design and analysis of bias shifting algorithms. The Baldwin effect was proposed in 1896 to explain how phenomena that might appear to require Lamarckian evolution (inheritance of acquired characteristics) can arise from purely Darwinian evolution. Hinton and Nowlan presented a computational model of the Baldwin effect in 1987. We explore a variation on their model, which we constructed explicitly to illustrate the lessons that the Baldwin effect has for research in bias shifting algorithms. The main lesson is that it appears that a good strategy for shift of bias in a learning algorithm is to begin with a weak bias and gradually shift to a strong bias.

1704	Optimization of superconducting bending magnets for a 1.0 to 1.5 GeV compact light source	Green, M.A.; Garren, A.A.	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Compact light sources are being proposed for protein crystallography, medical imaging, nano-machining and other areas of study that require intense sources of X-rays at energies up to 35 keV. In order for a synchrotron light source to be attractive, its capital cost must be kept low. The proposed compact light source has superconducting bending elements to bend the stored beam and produce the X-rays. Additional focusing for the machine is provided by conventional quadrupoles. An important part of the cost optimization of a compact light source is the cost of the bending magnets. In the case of a machine with superconducting bending elements, the bending magnet system can represent close to half of the storage ring cost. The compact light source storage rings studied here have a range of stored electron energies from 1.0 to 1.5 GeV, For a number of reasons, it is desirable to keep the storage ring circumference below 30 meters. Cost optimization parameters include: (1) the number of superconducting bending elements in the ring, and (2) the central induction of the dipole. A machine design that features two superconducting dipoles in a single cryostat vacuum vessel is also discussed	,Biomedical imaging;Cost function;Crystallography;Focusing;Light sources;Proteins;Storage rings;Superconducting magnets;Synchrotrons;X-rays,accelerator magnets;electron accelerators;optimisation;storage rings;superconducting magnets1 to 1.5 GeV;30 m;compact light source;cost optimization;cryostat vacuum vessel;focusing;quadrupoles;storage ring circumference;superconducting bending magnets;synchrotron light source							
1705	AI tools for business-process modeling	Hedberg, S.	IEEE Expert	20020806	For more than a decade, artificial intelligence techniques have served as critical building blocks for cutting edge business applications. Knowledge based systems (KBS) in particular have helped numerous Fortune 1000 companies solve pressing business problems-everything from scheduling their manufacturing operations to managing their investment portfolios. AI has helped many companies improve productivity and reduce costs to meet the demands of today's competitive global economy. Today, business management itself is undergoing fundamental change. For the past several years, business process reengineering (BPR) has become the watchword. This move to rethink and redesign the way a company works aims at further boosting productivity and cutting costs. No wonder then that business managers worldwide are turning to explicit KBS techniques, long proven to achieve the very goals of BPR, to model change. The first wave of AI based tools and applications for business process modeling (BPM) is just hitting the shore. Organizations such as IBM, EDS, the US Army, and Swiss Bank are among the first to adopt AI for BPM.

This paper reports the results of an investigation of the effect of PWM drives on the insulation of the stator winding. The characteristics of the employed dielectric material and the magnitude of the applied voltages led to the hypothesis of the possible existence of partial discharges within the insulation. Practical experiments were carried out and high frequency signals which could be associated with such a phenomenon were observed. These measurements also showed that the interturn insulation undergoes some high electrical stresses and that the nominal rotation speed (50 Hz) appears to be a point of high disturbance in the working of the motor. Further work is required, since most of the points identified here need to be understood fully	,Dielectric materials;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Induction machines;Induction motors;Low voltage;Partial discharges;Pulse width modulation;Space vector pulse width modulation;Stator windings;Variable speed drives,induction motor drives;induction motors;machine insulation;partial discharges;pulse width modulation;stators;variable speed drives50 Hz;PWM adjustable speed drive;dielectric material;electrical stress;high frequency signal;insulation;low voltage induction motor;partial discharge;stator winding

Nevertheless, we show that the experimental results of stronger excitonﾖphonon coupling in the quaternary SQW structure would lead to partial ionization of free excitons at temperatures above 125 K, in good agreement with the line-shape analysis of the luminescence spectra which clearly shows the presence of band-to-band recombination. ﾩ 1996 American Institute of Physics.

1711	Visual representation of natural language scene descriptions	Giunchiglia, E.; Armando, A.; Traverso, P.; Cimatti, A.	Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	We are mainly interested in the development of CAD systems for interior design. An effective use of such systems relies to a large extent on the characteristics of their user interface. This paper describes NALIG, a system able to ﾓunderstandﾔ and ﾓreason aboutﾔ high level descriptions of spatial scenes. The user interacts with the system by using a natural language interface which, though very simple, is expressive enough to allow the description of complex configurations of objects. NALIG replies by drawing on the screen an image mirroring its own ﾓunderstandingﾔ of the scene described. The comprehension process has required the integration of different AI-techniques (e.g., natural language understanding, spatial reasoning, default and common sense reasoning)	,Control systems;Design automation;Information systems;Layout;Natural languages;Parallel processing;Solids;Technical drawing;User interfaces,architectural CAD;natural language interfaces;spatial reasoningCAD systems;NALIG;common sense reasoning;comprehension;interior design;natural language interface;natural language scene descriptions;natural language understanding;spatial reasoning;user interface							
1712	Relevance and insight in experimental studies	Langley, P.	IEEE Expert	20020806	As its name suggests, artificial intelligence is a science of the artificial. As with other conscious creations, there is a great temptation to assume that we can understand the behavior of AI systems entirely through formal analysis. However, the complexity of most AI constructs makes this impractical, forcing us to rely on the same experimental approach that has been so useful in the natural sciences. Many of the same issues and methods apply directly to AI systems, including the need to identify clearly one's dependent and independent variables, the importance of careful experimental design, and the need to average across random variables outside one's control. However, beyond these obvious features, a compelling experimental study of intelligent behavior must satisfy two additional criteria: it must have relevance and it must produce insight. I will illustrate these ideas with examples from machine learning, one of the most experimentally oriented subfields within artificial intelligence. Moreover, because AI researchers are often concerned with extending some existing method to improve its behavior, I will focus on this paradigm	,Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Learning systems;Machine learning;Medical diagnosis;Random variables;Rockets;System testing;Training data;Turning,artificial intelligence;learning (artificial intelligence)AI systems;artificial intelligence;experimental studies;machine learning							
1713	High resolution x-ray tomography in an electron microprobe	de Paiva, Rogerio Ferreira; Bisiaux, Michel; Lynch, John; Rosenberg, Elisabeth	Review of Scientific Instruments	20090618	Conversion of an electron microprobe for use as an x-ray microtomograph is described. Only minor modifications are required, indeed several of the utilities of the microprobe can be used to ensure high resolution radiography and tomography. System performance was evaluated by analysis of glass fiber reinforced polymer composites and of a carbonate reservoir rock. Individual glass fibers of 10 and 20 ?m diameter are clearly visible in the former. In the latter, comparison with scanning electron micrographs shows reliable reconstruction of external morphology. In addition, internal pore structure can be studied a posteriori using the tomography data. Spatial resolutions in radiography of better than 3 ?m and in tomography of 10 ?m have been demonstrated. Further improvements to the detector system and increased data handling capacity are possible to achieve 1 ?m resolution tomographic images. ﾩ 1996 American Institute of Physics.

It was found that a metastable phase appeared at the first stage of the crystallization process and then the metastable phase was transformed into a stable crystalline phase at higher annealing temperatures. The x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy results indicated the metastable phase was identified as a face-centered-cubic structure and the stable crystalline phase corresponded to a hexagonal structure. Our experimental results show that the Ge1Sb2Te4 materials are applicable for phase change erasable optical storage. ﾩ 1995 American Institute of Physics.

1725	Relating Stable Models and AI Planning Domains		Logic Programming:The 12th International Conference	20121008	In this paper, we show that there is a simple connection between logic programming and planning. The main result of this paper is the following: given any planning domain consisting of an initial state, and a set of operation definitions, this domain can be translated, in linear-time, to a logic program such that a given goal G is achievable in the planning domain if a related goal G* is true in some stable model of the logic program obtained by the translation. We show that this translation yields at least two interesting consequences: (1) methods to update databases can be used to handle surprises when executing plans (i.e. a surprise occurs when an initial plan is partly executed, but one of the resulting intermediate states differs, perhaps due to external reasons, from what is predicted). (2) rigid actions, which are actions that roust be executed when their pre-conditions are true, can be easily accommodated within our framework as well.

Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Photoluminescence and absorption measurements were carried out on quaternary Ga0.75In0.25As0.04Sb0.96 /Al0.22Ga0.78As0.02Sb0.93 strained multiple quantum well (MQW) structure grown by molecular-beam epitaxy to investigate its band offsets and subband behavior. Strong luminescence and well-resolved excitonic absorption peaks are observed even at room temperature, which is indicative of good quality of our quaternary sample. By fitting the experimental results with the theoretical calculations, we find that the light holes are in Ga0.75In0.25As0.04Sb0.98 well regions (type I MQW) and the conduction-band offset ratio Qc=0.66ﾱ0.01. The transition from type I to type II for light holes may occur for the composition of x?0.70 in GaxIn1-xAs0.04Sb0.96/ Al0.22Ga0.78As0.02Sb0.98 system. ﾩ 1995 American Institute of Physics.

1737	A profile of AIAI	Macintosh, A.	IEEE Expert	20020806	In the early 1980s, the University of Edinburgh embarked on a technology transfer experiment. Ten years on, that experiment has proved a huge success. In 1984, the University took the novel step of establishing the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI) as the answer to the ever-growing request from industry for advanced information technology assistance to solve complex business problems. AIAI has been so successful in addressing business needs that many of its early clients from 10 years ago are still its clients today. It now employs about 20 technical staff and has an annual turnover just short of ﾣ1 million. Jim Howe, head of the University's Department of AI, was instrumental in its establishment and retains his connection with AIAI as the chairman of its advisory board. Our mission is to help companies address key business needs through the introduction of AI and knowledge-based systems technologies. We work with our clients, rather than for them, providing them with the skills necessary to develop innovative solutions that meet complex business requirements. We not only provide solutions but, importantly, demonstrate how these solutions were reached-we literally transfer the technology	artificial intelligence;business data processing;knowledge based systems;technology transferAIAI;Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute;Edinburgh University;advanced information technology assistance;business needs;complex business problem solving;complex business requirements;industry;innovative solutions;knowledge-based systems technologies;technology transfer experiment

1741	Parallel natural language processing on a semantic network array processor	Chung, M.; Moldovan, D.I.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	This paper presents a parallel natural language processing system implemented on a marker-passing parallel AI computer, the Semantic Network Array Processor (SNAP). Our system uses a memory-based parsing approach in which parsing is viewed as a memory search process. Linguistic information is stored as phrasal patterns in a semantic network knowledge base distributed over the memory of the parallel computer. Parsing is performed by recognizing and linking phrasal patterns that reflect a sentence interpretation. This is achieved by propagating markers over the distributed network. We have developed a system capable of processing newswire articles from a particular domain. The paper presents the structure of the system, the memory-based parsing method used, and the performance results obtained.	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer vision;Concurrent computing;Knowledge representation;Natural language processing;Parallel processing;Senior members,grammars;knowledge representation;natural language interfaces;parallel processing;semantic networksmarker-passing parallel AI computer;memory-based parsing approach;parallel natural language processing;performance results;phrasal patterns;semantic network array processor;semantic network knowledge base;sentence interpretation

1747	Reasoning in qualitatively defined systems using interval-based difference equations	Kiang, M.Y.; Hinkkanen, A.; Whinston, A.B.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Quantitative research and statistical techniques have long been regarded as superior ways of analyzing knowledge in social sciences. To deal with incomplete or imprecise knowledge while modeling systems, traditional approaches in social sciences (i.e., management science, operations research) have attempted to measure social facts by making approximations of the problem under analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) research on qualitative reasoning which focuses on using qualitative knowledge to reason about the everyday physical world, suggests an opportunity to extend the capability of current logico-mathematical instruments used by social scientists. This paper proposes an interval propagation difference equation method, a type of qualitative-quantitative simulation method, to model dynamic systems by abstracting from the underlying true model. The proposed difference equation method can be used to model problems requiring discrete-time analysis, such as applications involving time-lag relationships. Moreover, the method does not require the exact functional form of the problem under analysis to be known with certainty. The incomplete or imprecise knowledge available about the functional form of the true model, and the values of its variables, are represented with bounding functions and interval values respectively	,Artificial intelligence;Difference equations;Humans;Information analysis;Instruments;Knowledge management;Management information systems;Mathematical programming;Operations research;Statistical analysis,convergence;difference equations;inference mechanisms;problem solving;social sciencesbounding functions;discrete-time analysis;dynamic systems;imprecise knowledg;incomplete knowledge;interval propagation difference equation method;qualitative knowledge;qualitative reasoning;qualitative-quantitative simulation method;qualitatively defined systems;social sciences;time-lag relationships

1751	Expert system for analysis of electric power system harmonics	Shipp, D.D.; Vilcheck, W.; Swartz, M.E.; Woodley, N.H.	Industry Applications Magazine, IEEE	20020806	The proliferation of power electronics devices that cause harmonic voltages and currents and the widespread use of harmonics-sensitive electronic equipment are creating a near-epidemic of ﾓpower qualityﾔ issues that are being addressed by both users and suppliers of electric energy. Numerous types, styles, and capabilities exist in the field of instrumentation and diagnostic equipment for the detection, recording, and analysis of the distorted waveform. This article reports on one effort to employ artificial intelligence (Al) in the form of a Harmonics Analysis Expert System (HAES). The resulting PC-based software program has captured the knowledge of expert power system engineers in a ﾓrule baseﾔ which can be applied to information about the topology, power signature, operating practices, symptoms, equipment, type and ratings, and chronology of system development to diagnose the power system for harmonics-caused problems. The goal is to accomplish the analysis with a less experienced engineer, thereby multiplying the available nationwide pool of expertise. Additionally, repeated use of the system does result in impartation of knowledge from the system to the user. The process of applying this AI approach involves: (1) training the user, (2) measurements (optional), (3) diagnosis, and (4) solution of the power system for harmonics disturbances to acceptable power quality. The emphasis of this paper is on the diagnostic module (Al program) with a usage example presented	,Artificial intelligence;Electronic equipment;Expert systems;Harmonic analysis;Instruments;Power electronics;Power engineering and energy;Power system analysis computing;Power system harmonics;Voltage,diagnostic expert systems;harmonic distortion;power electronics;power supply quality;power system analysis computing;power system harmonicsHarmonics Analysis Expert System;PC-based software program;artificial intelligence;diagnostic equipment;distorted waveform analysis;distorted waveform detection;distorted waveform recording;electric power system harmonics;expert power system engineers;expert system;harmonics-sensitive electronic equipment;instrumentation;operating practices;power electronics devices;power quality;power signature;topology							
1752	An expert system approach for cellular CDMA	Ulloa, J.A.; Taylor, D.P.; Poehlman, W.F.S.	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The demand for cordless communication has forced suppliers to exploit digital technology to satisfy the increasing demand for service. This demand has led to severe capacity limitations in many areas and spread spectrum techniques are being considered as one means to support these services. It is generally accepted that system control in the future will make use of intelligent processors. In this study we delineate an expert system to be used as an intelligent controller for a cell site working in a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) mobile cellular telecommunications system. An existing AI shell is used for program development and simulation and the results are discussed in terms of the benefits obtained by using an expert system approach in the highly dynamic environment of cellular mobile communications	,Communication system control;Control systems;Expert systems;Frequency division multiaccess;Interference;Mobile communication;Multiaccess communication;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication control;Time division multiple access,cellular radio;code division multiple access;digital simulation;expert systems;software engineering;spread spectrum communication;telecommunication computingAI shell;cellular CDMA;code division multiple access;cordless communication;digital technology;expert system;intelligent processors;mobile cellular telecommunications system;program development;simulation;spread spectrum techniques;system control

1755	The process of research investigations in artificial intelligence-a unified view	Baldwin, D.; Yadav, S.B.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	A number of research communities recognize artificial intelligence (AI) as a valid reference discipline. However, several papers have criticized AI's research methodologies. This paper attempts to clarify and improve the methods used in AI. Definitions are proposed for terms such as AI theory, principles, hypotheses, and observations. Next, a unified view of AI research methodology is proposed. This methodology contains a long term dimension based upon the scientific method and an individual project dimension. The individual project dimension identifies four strategies: hypothetical/deductive, hermeneutical/inductive, case-based, and historical analysis. The strategies differ according to how prototyping is used in an experiment	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Cybernetics;Design engineering;Information systems;Instruments;Management information systems;Prototypes;Systems engineering and theory,artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence;case-based strategies;hermeneutical/inductive strategies;historical analysis;hypothetical/deductive strategies;reference discipline;research communities;research investigations;research methodology							
1756	Minimum-seeking properties of analog neural networks with multilinear objective functions	Vidyasagar, M.	Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing a multilinear objective function over the discrete set {0, 1}n. This is an extension of an earlier work addressed to the problem of minimizing a quadratic function over {0, 1}n. A gradient-type neural network is proposed to perform the optimization. A novel feature of the network is the introduction of a so-called bias vector. The network is operated in the high-gain region of the sigmoidal nonlinearities. The following comprehensive theorem is proved: For all sufficiently small bias vectors except those belonging to a set of measure zero, for all sufficiently large sigmoidal gains, for all initial conditions except those belonging to a nowhere dense set, the state of the network converges to a local minimum of the objective function. This is a considerable generalization of earlier results for quadratic objective functions. Moreover, the proofs here are completely rigorous. The neural network-based approach to optimization is briefly compared to the so-called interior-point methods of nonlinear programming, as exemplified by Karmarkar's algorithm.

1757	AI approach to optimal VAr control with fuzzy reactive loads	Abdul-Rahman, K.H.; Shahidehpour, S.M.; Daneshdoost, M.	Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	This paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the optimal reactive power (VAr) control problem. The method incorporates the reactive load uncertainty in optimizing the overall system performance. The artificial neural network (ANN) enhanced by fuzzy sets is used to determine the memberships of control variables corresponding to the given load values. A power flow solution determines the corresponding state of the system. Since the resulting system state may not be feasible in real-time, a heuristic method based on the application of sensitivities in an expert system is employed to refine the solution with minimum adjustments of control variables. Test cases and numerical results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Simplicity, processing speed and ability to model load uncertainties make this approach a viable option for online VAr control	,Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy sets;Optimal control;Optimization methods;Reactive power;Reactive power control;System performance;Uncertainty,expert systems;fuzzy neural nets;heuristic programming;load flow;load regulation;optimal control;power system control;reactive power controlAI;artificial intelligence;control variables membership;expert system;fuzzy reactive loads;fuzzy sets;heuristic method;neural network;optimal VAr control;performance;power flow;power systems;processing speed;real-time;sensitivities;uncertainty

1761	Index		Digital Mantras:The Languages of Abstract and Virtual Worlds	20121008	Computer technology is making possible new worlds of expression that are already being explored by a growing subculture of artists, musicians, virtual reality enthusiasts, and cyberpunks. In Digital Mantras, Steven Holtzman synthesizes ideas from a number of different disciplines to arrive at a new philosophy of creativity for the digital age.Blending ideas from music, computing, art, and philosophy, with biographical and historical anecdotes and a thread of mysticism, Holtzman gives us new ways to think about the integration of computers into the creative process. He shows how computers will change the way we create, and reveals the exciting potential for entirely new forms of expression. Running throughout the book are episodes from Holtzman's own sometimes mystical journey in search of the personal aesthetic he presents.Holtzman explores the presence and use of structure in fields as diverse as the development of ancient human languages, the philosophy of the Buddhist monk Nagarjuna and the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the music of Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern, the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky, and the pioneering grammars of Panini and Noam Chomsky. He then turns to the use of computers for building abstract and virtual worlds in language, music, and art as well as virtual reality, and surveys the work of AI pioneer Terry Winograd, composers Gottfried Michael Koenig and Iannis Xenakis, and artist Harold Cohen. Holtzman concludes by discussing the aesthetic implications of these new worlds. He introduces the concept of digital expression, along with examples that hint at its far-reaching possibilities.								
1762	Hybrid connectionist systems in research and teaching	Jain, L.C.	Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, IEEE	20020806	There is a tremendous world-wide interest in the development of the theory and application of artificial intelligence (AI) and related techniques both in tertiary institutions and in industry. This paper presents a brief survey of overseas AI teaching programs together with a review of the teaching program in the University of South Australia. In addition, post-graduate projects undertaken by the Knowledge-Engineering Systems Group (KES), and sponsored by the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), are discussed. These involve expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. It is shown by using a classical exclusive-OR problem that it is useful to use hybrid techniques which offer fast convergence in optimization problems. Although much of this work is still at an early stage, sufficient progress has been made to demonstrate the merit of using AI and related techniques to help create solutions to these problems	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Australia;Education;Expert systems;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Knowledge engineering;Neural networks;Systems engineering and theory,artificial intelligence;educational technology;engineering education;expert systems;knowledge based systems;neural nets;research and development management;teachingKnowledge-Engineering Systems Group;University of South Australia;artificial intelligence;convergence;exclusive-OR problem;expert systems;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithms;hybrid connectionist system;hybrid techniques;neural networks;optimization;overseas AI teaching;research;teaching;tertiary institutions							
1763	The wavelength shift in GaInAsSb photodiode structures	Ru, Guoping; Zheng, Yanlan; Aizhen Li	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Infrared absorption spectra of molecular beam epitaxial grown GaInAsSb alloys, GaInAsSb p-i-n and p-n photodiode structures are reported. It is found that the absorption edge of the N-type GaInAsSb has a blue shift compared with that of the unintentionally doped GaInAsSb, which is thought to be the MossﾖBurstein shift. On the other hand, the absorption edges of the p-i-n and p-n photodiode structures have red shifts compared to the respective layers, which results from the built-in field induced FranzﾖKeldysh effect. By using the WKB method, we have calculated the absorption spectra for photons of energy less than the energy gap. The theoretically predicted red shift is in good agreement with the experimental results. ﾩ 1995 American Institute of Physics.

Journal of Applied Physics	20090618	We report the dependence on the excitation power and temperature of the photoluminescence emission from a quaternary Ga0.75In0.25As0.04Sb0.96/Al0.22Ga0.78As 02Sb0.98 strained multiple- quantum-well structure grown by molecular-beam epitaxy. Sharp exciton resonances are observed up to room temperature and have been attributed to localized excitons for temperatures ?80ﾖ100 K and to free excitons at higher temperatures up to room temperature by a comparative study with temperature-dependent absorption spectroscopy. We conclude that the dominant luminescence quenching mechanism in this quaternary system is mainly due to the trapped excitons thermalizing from the localized regions below 100 K, and the thermal carrier activation from the first electron and heavy-hole subbands to the second electron and heavy-hole subbands at higher temperatures. ﾩ 1995 American Institute of Physics.

We present a domain-specific software architecture (DSSA) that we have developed for a large application domain of adaptive intelligent systems (AISs). The DSSA provides: (a) an AIS reference architecture designed to meet the functional requirements shared by applications in this domain, (b) principles for decomposing expertise into highly reusable components, and (c) an application configuration method for selecting relevant components from a library and automatically configuring instances of those components in an instance of the architecture. The AIS reference architecture incorporates features of layered, pipe and filter, and blackboard style architectures.

1766	Surviving the AI Winter		Logic Programming:The 1995 International Symposium	20121008	The promise of AI miracles during the 80s was a big enticement to large corporations such as Boeing. Significant investments were made, but real breakthroughs were very rare and both time and patience ran out before some of the most interesting projects had a chance to bear fruit. However, despite the inherently conservative nature of management at all levels and the numerous gates that new ideas must pass through, an encouraging number of AI projects found their way to production usage. It is disappointing that many of those systems have since disappeared This paper addresses the issues surrounding those systems that have succeeded in the areas of intelligent CAD, natural language understanding, and data management. It also examines some of the factors that led to the demise of some AI systems such as XCON and CASEy that looked so promising in the beginning. Both business and technical reasons are explored from an industrial perspective and some suggestions are offered to help assess the merits of future projects

We describe in details the design consideration, practical fabrication, and characterization of this fiber. The distinctive feature of this fiber is that the principal axes of the constituent fibers can be accurately aligned in the preform stage so that long lengths of well-aligned fiber can be drawn. We further demonstrate the application of this fiber by fabricating a polarization-maintaining coupler by simply introducing a local taper. Measurements show that such a coupler can have polarization extinction ratio as large as 31 dB (in the best case)	,Australia Council;Birefringence;Extinction ratio;Fabrication;Gyroscopes;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber couplers;Optical fiber devices;Optical fiber polarization;Preforms,birefringence;drawing (mechanical);optical design techniques;optical fibre couplers;optical fibre fabrication;optical fibre polarisationBISPEC fiber fabrication;birefringent splittable composite fiber;constituent fibers;design consideration;local taper;polarization extinction ratio;polarization-maintaining coupler;polarization-maintaining couplers;preform stage;principal axes;well-aligned fiber

Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, IEEE	20020806	This research has shown that features extracted from color skin tumor images by computer vision methods can be reliable discriminators of malignant tumors from benign ones. Reliability was demonstrated by the monotonically increasing success ratios with increasing training set size and by the small standard deviations from the mean success rates. An average success rate of 70 percent in diagnosing melanoma was attained for a training set size of 60 percent. The presence or absence of atypical moles in the training and test sets was shown to have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of the generated classification rules. This was the case with both AIM and lst-Class, and indicates a high potential for success if a method can be found for discriminating between atypical moles and melanoma	,Artificial intelligence;Computer languages;Decision trees;Induction generators;Malignant tumors;Operating systems;Pixel;Skin neoplasms;Spatial resolution;Sun,artificial intelligence;computer vision;feature extraction;medical image processing;skin35 mm;35 mm color slides;AI methods performance;AIM numeric modeling tool;atypical moles;benign tumors;color skin tumor images;computer vision methods;lst-Class software;mean success rates;medical diagnostic imaging;melanoma detection;monotonically increasing success ratios;training set size

This system aims for improved practicability by using time-tagged data from circuit breakers, protective relays, and automatic reclosing relays in addition to the input data used in earlier systems. Furthermore, this system also uses data from fault detection systems that locate fault points within electric stations. This system uses an AI-specific back-end processor to perform inferencing rapidly. Additionally, this fault diagnosis expert system is interfaced and integrated with a restorative operations expert system, an intelligent alarm processing system, and a protective relay setting and management system.

1773	Integrating multiple paradigms within the blackboard framework	Vranes, S.; Stanojevic&#x0301;, M.	Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The complexity and diversity of real world applications have forced researchers in the AI field to focus more on the integration of diverse knowledge representation and reasoning techniques for solving challenging, real world problems. Our development environment, BEST (Blackboard based Expert Systems Toolkit), is aimed to provide the ability to produce large scale, evolvable, heterogeneous intelligent systems. BEST incorporates the best of multiple programming paradigms in order to avoid restricting users to a single way of expressing either knowledge or data. It combines rule based programming, object oriented programming, logic programming, procedural programming and blackboard modelling in a single architecture for knowledge engineering, so that the user can tailor a style of programming to his application, using any or arbitrary combinations of methods to provide a complete solution. The deep integration of all these techniques yields a toolkit more effective even for a specific single application than any technique in isolation or collections of multiple techniques less fully integrated. Within the basic, knowledge based programming paradigm, BEST offers a multiparadigm language for representing complex knowledge, including incomplete and uncertain knowledge. Its problem solving facilities include truth maintenance, inheritance over arbitrary relations, temporal and hypothetical reasoning, opportunistic control, automatic partitioning and scheduling and both blackboard and distributed problem solving paradigms	,Artificial intelligence;Expert systems;Intelligent systems;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge representation;Large-scale systems;Logic programming;Object oriented modeling;Object oriented programming;Problem-solving,blackboard architecture;expert system shells;expert systems;logic programming;object-oriented programming;problem solvingBEST;Blackboard based Expert Systems Toolkit;automatic partitioning;blackboard framework;blackboard modelling;development environment;distributed problem solving;heterogeneous intelligent systems;hypothetical reasoning;knowledge based programming paradigm;knowledge engineering;logic programming;multiparadigm language;multiple programming paradigms;object oriented programming;opportunistic control;procedural programming;real world applications;rule based programming;scheduling;truth maintenance;uncertain knowledge							
1774	On the history of AI applications. II. IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications	O'Leary, D.E.	IEEE Expert	20020806	An understanding of the history of AI applications through its primary conferences is important for several reasons. First, it provides insight into some of the pioneers to the field and their contributions. Second, it sheds light on the nature of the contributions of academic and nonacademic organizations to the field of AI applications. Third, the national origins of the organizations supporting AI applications reflect the international structure of AI applications. Accordingly, this review focuses on the authors of papers specializing in AI applications and their organizations and countries of origin, and on the program committee members, and their organizations and countries of origin. This review takes a quantitative approach to analyzing the history of AI applications. The IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications (CAIA) is one of the first and longest running applications conferences to specialize on AI application issues. This article provides an initial view of the history of the CAIA and of AI applications in general since 1984. It gathers information regarding both the research papers and committee members, the two primary sources of data in the proceedings. This article considers quantity issues, making inferences based on various statistics. However, it ignores what might be called quality issues, since each paper goes through the same referee process required for the conference	artificial intelligence;computer applications;history;professional aspects;societiesAI applications;IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications;academic organizations;history;international structure;national origins;nonacademic organizations;pioneers;program committee members;quantitative approach;research papers;statistics							
1775	Frictional behavior of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite	Ruan, Ju&#x2010;Ai; Bhushan, B.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Friction of a freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface and a roughened graphite surface against a silicon nitride tip is measured using a friction force microscope. The cleaved graphite surface is an atomically smooth surface of (0001) plane with a small fraction of line-shaped regions. It is observed that the coefficient of friction is extremely small (?0.006) for a freshly cleaved HOPG surface of (0001) plane. However, the coefficient of friction is more than an order of magnitude larger in some line-shaped regions on the surface compared with that of smooth regions of (0001) planes. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicates that the line-shaped regions consist of graphite planes of different orientations [other than (0001)] as well as amorphous carbon. This result suggests that (0001) graphite planes have the lowest coefficient of friction in comparison with other surface orientations or amorphous carbon. The coefficient of friction of a roughened graphite surface is found to be much larger than that of cleaved graphite. These observations may explain the large differences between the atomic-scale coefficient of friction of graphite (usually cleaved) (about 0.006 or even less) and its macroscopic counterpart (about 0.1). ﾩ 1994 American Institute of Physics.

1776	Relationship between user models in HCI and AI	Johnson, H.	Computers and Digital Techniques, IEE Proceedings -	20020806	Considers the relationship between the two independent lines of research into user modelling activities in human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI). The paper begins by considering the potential use of AI user models in HCI. The user modelling research conducted in HCI and AI respectively is then discussed along with the goals of HCI and AI. Considerable differences underlie the apparent similarities of the respective research in user modelling in HCI and AI and we discuss these distinctions from the viewpoint of the roles, nature, goals and development of user models. It is argued that HCI can contribute techniques concerned with gathering and modelling user requirements to AI, and in addition a view of how the results of employing AI user models might be evaluated. On the other hand, sophisticated knowledge representation techniques can be provided by AI to the use of embedded user models in HCI	artificial intelligence;knowledge representation;user modellingAI user models;artificial intelligence;embedded user models;human-computer interaction;knowledge representation techniques;user modelling;user requirements							
1777	Dynamic construction and refinement of utility-based categorization models	Kim Leng Poh; Fehling, M.R.; Horvitz, E.J.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The actions taken by an automated decision-making agent can be enhanced by including mechanisms that enable the agent to categorize concepts effectively. We pose a utility-based approach to categorization based on the idea that categorization should be carried out in the service of action. The choice of concepts is critical in the effective selection of actions under resource constraints. We propose a decision-theoretic framework for categorization which involves reasoning about alternative categorization models consisting of sets of interrelated concepts at varying levels of abstraction. Categorization models that are too abstract may overlook details that are critical for selecting the most appropriate actions. Categorization models that are too detailed, however, may be too expensive to process and may contain irrelevant information. Categorization models are therefore evaluated on the basis of the expected value of their recommended action, taking into account the resource cost of their evaluation. A knowledge representation scheme, known as probabilistic conceptual networks, has been developed to support the dynamic construction of models at varying levels of abstraction. This scheme combines the formalisms of influence diagrams from decision analysis and inheritance/abstraction hierarchies from AI. We also propose an incremental approach to categorical reasoning. By applying decision-theoretic control of model refinement, a resource-constrained actor iteratively decides between continuing to improve the current level of abstraction in the model, or to act immediately	,Artificial intelligence;Costs;Decision making;Decision theory;Helium;Intelligent systems;Knowledge representation;Laboratories;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Systems engineering and theory,decision theory;inheritance;knowledge representation;pattern recognition;probabilityAI;automated decision-making agent;categorical reasoning;decision analysis;decision-theoretic framework;dynamic construction;incremental approach;influence diagrams;inheritance/abstraction hierarchies;knowledge representation scheme;probabilistic conceptual networks;resource constraints;resource cost;utility-based categorization model refinement

1780	Applying parallel processing to natural-language processing	Chung, M.; Moldevan, D.	IEEE Expert	20020806	Massively parallel computers offer not only improved speed but also a new perspective on computer vision, production systems, neural networks, and other AI applications. However, not much work has been done to apply parallel processing to natural-language processing, even though most sequential natural-language systems slow down as knowledge bases grow to realistic sizes and as linguistic features are added to handle special cases. To demonstrate the potential of parallel systems for natural-language processing, we selected an inherently parallel knowledge representation and reasoning method (marker-passing in a semantic network) and then developed a natural-language processor based on it. We implemented the memory-based parsing system/spl minus/called Parallel/spl minus/on a marker-passing parallel computer especially designed for natural-language processing.>	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computer networks;Computer vision;Concurrent computing;Knowledge representation;Neural networks;Parallel processing;Process design;Production systems,grammars;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;natural language interfaces;natural languages;parallel machines;parallel programming;semantic networksAI applications;Parallel;knowledge bases;linguistic features;marker-passing;marker-passing parallel computer;massively parallel computers;memory-based parsing system;natural-language processing;parallel knowledge representation;parallel processing;parallel reasoning;reasoning method;semantic network							
1781	The intelligent machine	Davies, A.	Manufacturing Engineer	20020806	The concept of using condition monitoring (CM) to monitor automated small batch production equipment is now rapidly gaining ground in manufacturing industry due, in the main, to the wide availability of powerful and highly reliable electronic sensing systems, together with advances in computer technology and its associated software. Real time actual condition knowledge or RTACK data, obtained and analysed automatically during the production process, permits the application of many concepts which underpin the methodologies of both condition monitoring and artificial intelligence (AI). These, when used together, have the potential to allow a machine to exhibit intelligence, in the sense that it can be made aware of its environment/health and allowed to adaptively control one to the benefit of the other. The author outlines developments within condition monitoring applied to machining systems, exploring the development of automated, intelligent and unstaffed machining systems	computerised monitoring;intelligent control;machiningRTACK data;artificial intelligence;batch production equipment;computer technology;condition monitoring;electronic sensing systems;intelligent machine;unstaffed machining systems							
1782	Power system dynamic load modeling using artificial neural networks	Bih-Yuan Ku; Thomas, R.J.; Chiou, C.-Y.; Lin, Chia-Jen	Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The dynamic characteristics of power system loads are critical to obtaining quality operating point-prediction and stability calculations. The composition of components at a load bus makes the aggregated behavior too complicated to be expressed by a simple form. Armed with the theorems recently developed on the approximation capability of artificial neural networks, the authors devise a load model to describe the complex dynamic behavior of loads. Real field data are used to train and test this model. The results verify that this model can emulate load dynamics well and should therefore be suitable as a representation of load for stability analysis	,Artificial neural networks;Impedance;Load modeling;Power system analysis computing;Power system dynamics;Power system modeling;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Testing;Voltage,approximation theory;digital simulation;learning (artificial intelligence);load (electric);neural nets;power system analysis computing;power system stabilityAI;approximation capability;artificial neural networks;computer simulation;dynamic characteristics;load bus;operating point-prediction;power system loads;stability calculations;testing;training							
1783	Fabrication of large area Si cylindrical drift detectors	Wei Chen; Kraner, H.W.; Zheng Li; Rehak, P.; Hess, F.	Nuclear Science, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The processing of an advanced silicon detector, a large area cylindrical drift detector (CDD), was carried out in the BNL Instrumentation Division Fabrication Facility. The double-sided planar process technique was developed for the fabrication of the CDD. Important improvements of the double-sided planar process in this fabrication include the introduction of an AI implantation protection mask and implantation of boron through an 1000 angstrom oxide layer in the step of opening the p-window. Another important aspect of the design of the CDD is the structure called ﾓriver,ﾔ which allows the current generated on the Si-SiO2 interface to ﾓflowﾔ into the guard anode, and thus minimize the leakage current at the signal anode. The test result showed that for the best detector most of the signal anodes have leakage currents of about 0.3 nA/cm2	,Anodes;Artificial intelligence;Boron;Detectors;Fabrication;Instruments;Leakage current;Protection;Signal design;Silicon,leakage currents;semiconductor countersSi;Si cylindrical drift detectors;Si-Si02 interface;Si-SiO2;design;double-sided planar process;fabrication;guard anode;large area;leakage current;river;signal anode

Computer	20020806	Describes the IXM2 associative processor and its main application in speech-to-speech translation. The IXM2 is a semantic memory system machine that began as a faithful implementation of the NETL semantic network machine and grew into a massively parallel SIMD machine that has demonstrated the power of large associative memories. Such processors can support robust performance in speech applications. In fact, the IXM2 with 73 transputers has outperformed a Cray in some language-translation tasks. We selected speech-to-speech translation as our main application because it is one of the grand challenges of massively parallel artificial intelligence. The social implications of successful automatic translation are enormous-e.g. people who speak different languages could communicate in real time by using interpreting telephony.>	,Artificial intelligence;Associative memory;Computer science;Dictionaries;Laboratories;Natural languages;Robustness;Speech processing;Terminology;Writing,associative processing;content-addressable storage;language translation;natural languages;parallel machines;speech processing;transputer systemsIXM2 parallel associative processor;NETL semantic network machine;artifical intelligence;associative memories;interpreting telephony;language-translation tasks;massively parallel SIMD machine;real-time communication;robust performance;semantic memory system machine;social implications;speech-to-speech translation;transputers							
1785	Atomic-scale and microscale friction studies of graphite and diamond using friction force microscopy	Ruan, Ju&#x2010;Ai; Bhushan, B.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Friction between graphite and diamond surfaces against a sharp silicon nitride tip was measured using a friction force microscope (FFM). Atomic-scale friction images of a freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite exhibited the same periodicity as that of the graphite surface; however, the peaks in friction profiles and those in corresponding topography profiles were displaced relative to each other. Using the Fourier expansion of the interaction potential, the conservative interatomic forces between the FFM tip and the graphite surface have been calculated. It is shown that the variations in atomic-scale friction and the observed displacement between the peaks in the frictional (or lateral) force and those in the corresponding topography can be explained by the variations in interatomic forces in the normal and lateral directions. Thus, the observed variation in friction force may not necessarily occur as a result of the commonly believed atomic-scale stick-slip process, but can be due to variation in the intrinsic lateral force between the sample and the FFM tip. At large scan sizes (50�50 nm2 or larger), the variation of friction for graphite and a single-crystal (IIa) diamond was found to correlate with the variations in the local slope of the sample surface, suggesting that a ratchet mechanism is responsible for variations in microscale friction.

Intelligent Systems Engineering	20020806	Owing to the increasing complexity of traditional real-time systems, there is a growing interest in applying AI techniques, and in particular knowledge-based systems, in this domain. However, the time- and memory-consuming AI algorithms, with unpredictable or highly variable performances, are usually not compatible with the strict requirements of real-time systems. The paper describes a software environment well adapted to the development and delivery of real-time knowledge-based systems. This environment is built around a multi-agent, multitask real-time architecture based on the blackboard model. The main aspect of the developed architecture is its ability to provide guaranteed response times, through the use of various scheduling techniques, among which is progressive reasoning	blackboard architecture;knowledge based systems;real-time systems;schedulingREAKT;blackboard model;guaranteed response times;memory-consuming AI algorithms;multi-agent multitask real-time architecture;progressive reasoning;real-time architecture;software environment;time-consuming AI algorithms;time-critical knowledge-based systems

Intelligent Systems Engineering	20020806	Better automation is a key to the improvement of industrial competitiveness. However, in most industrial plants, full automation is not possible because intelligent decisions play an essential part in guaranteeing the success of the production process. The currently favoured solution is to rely on human controllers for intelligent input, although instances of installations with AI-based control do exist. Our belief is that process control problems require the cooperative application of more than one AI technique to be successful, and that the lack of a common framework to support AI-based process control designs has contributed to their relative lack of penetration in the industrial market-place. The HINT Project (ESPRIT E6447) has been created to address this perceived need. We are engaged in developing a conceptual framework, a software architecture, and a methodology which will together support the integration of different AI techniques to provide solutions to process control problems that require the kind of intelligent supervision that is currently carried out by human operatives	industrial computer control;intelligent controlAI-based control;ESPRIT E6447;HINT Project;conceptual framework;heterogeneous integration architecture;intelligent control systems;intelligent decisions;intelligent input;process control;software architecture							
1792	AI-based generation of production engineering labor standards	Yazici, H.; Benjamin, C.; McGlaughlin, J.	Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Increased automation of manufacturing is necessary to compete in today's worldwide markets. The role of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for incorporating the automation with changing manufacturing environments needs to be investigated. AI techniques can assist in meeting the challenge of transforming shop floor production engineering data into appropriate production engineering labor standards in a timely, consistent, and cost effective manner. Production heuristics can be incorporated into an expert system that can learn from the changing manufacturing environment. This paper presents a prototype expert system which transfers the knowledge of experienced methods engineers into a rule-based system to develop the appropriate job elements and standard times for each engineering task. Manufacturing data taken from a leading US company are used for the testing and validation of the prototype system. The prototype system demonstrated the applicability of automated generation of knowledge transfer to the decomposition of the job into tasks.

1800	Using truth maintenance systems. A tutorial	Stanojevic&#x0301;, M.; Vranes, S.; Velasevic, D.	IEEE Expert	20020806	Truth maintenance (also called belief revision or reason maintenance) is an area of AI concerned with revising sets of beliefs and maintaining the truth in the system when new information contradicts existing information. Truth maintenance systems (TMSs) work with inference engines that act as problem solvers within large search spaces. The inference engine explores alternatives, makes choices, and examines the consequences of the choices. If a contradiction is detected during this process, the TMS eliminates it by revising the knowledge base. Together, the TMS and inference engine can solve problems where algorithmic solutions don't exist, and thus offer an efficient way to deal with search spaces that are large due to combinatorial explosions of alternatives. TMSs can be implemented either explicitly in search problem solving tools, or implicitly within applications that solve particular search problems. All applications that solve search problems have something in common that can be extracted and implemented within a tool. This tool can then solve new problems without programming everything from scratch.>	,Artificial intelligence;Data mining;Data structures;Decision trees;Inference algorithms;Knowledge representation;Problem-solving;Search problems;Tutorials,belief maintenance;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;problem solving;search problems;truth maintenanceAI;belief revision;combinatorial explosions;inference engines;knowledge base;large search spaces;problem solvers;reason maintenance;search problem solving tools;truth maintenance systems

1804	Necessary conditions for limit cycles in multiloop relay systems	Loh, A.P.; Vasnani, V.U.	Control Theory and Applications, IEE Proceedings -	20020806	The paper examines the behaviour of multivariable systems under multiloop relay feedback control. The analysis is a generalisation of the Tsypkin method (1984) for the prediction of forced oscillations in single variable systems. It is exact in the sense that a complete harmonic balance is considered in all the loops. The results are valid for systems with characteristic loci with phase lags more than 180ﾰ. It is shown that such multivariable systems under multiloop relay feedback may exhibit limit cycle oscillations in three possible modes. The first mode consists of identical relay outputs which are square waves with precisely one fundamental frequency. The second mode is characterised by relay outputs which are square waves of different fundamental frequencies in each loop. In this mode, each loop behaves like a single variable system oscillating at a unique limit cycle frequency. The third mode is one of periodic complex oscillations consisting of multiple relay switches within one fundamental period. The necessary conditions derived show that the modes are related to the strength of the interactions in the respective loops. The authors derive a graphical technique to determine when unique oscillations (with distinct frequencies) at the output of each relay may occur and when single frequency or complex oscillations may exist instead.

1806	AI-based planning for data analysis	Lansky, A.L.; Philpot, A.G.	IEEE Expert	20020806	Over the next 10 years (1994-2004), NASA plans to launch several satellites for studying Earth's ecosystems. This Earth Observing System is expected to provide about a terabyte of data per day. The authors have worked with Earth scientists at NASA Ames to encode the selection and preparation of this data as an AI-based planning task. They extended a domain independent planner called Collage, to meet the requirements of this domain, and are building a prototype application that selects and prepares data for ecosystem models. Collage is a successor to the Gemplan planner. Both systems were designed for large, complex planning domains and have been applied to standard toy problems as well as more realistic domains, such as building-construction planning. Two features distinguish Collage from other domain-independent planners. First, instead of state-based planning algorithms, Collage uses a broad repertoire of domain independent, action-based plan-construction algorithms. It can also be extended to include new planning methods, including domain-specific ones. Second, Collage uses localized search: using information about domain structure, the planner partitions a potentially intractable, global search space into smaller, more manageable ones, each working on a local subproblem of the overall task.>	,Application software;Data analysis;Earth;IEEE Computer Society Press;Image analysis;Meteorology;Satellite broadcasting;Soil;Turing machines;Vegetation mapping,data acquisition;data analysis;ecology;geophysics computing;knowledge based systems;planning (artificial intelligence)AI-based planning;AI-based planning task;Collage;Earth Observing System;Earth ecosystems;Gemplan planner;NASA;action-based plan-construction algorithms;complex planning domains;data analysis;domain independent planner;domain structure;domain-independent planners;ecosystem models;global search space;local subproblem;localized search;prototype application							
1807	Learning sequential patterns for probabilistic inductive prediction	Chan, K.C.C.; Wong, Andrew K.C.; Chiu, D.K.Y.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Suppose we are given a sequence of events that are generated probabilistically in the sense that the attributes of one event are dependent, to a certain extent, on those observed before it. This paper presents an inductive method that is capable of detecting the inherent patterns in such a sequence and to make predictions about the attributes of future events. Unlike previous AI-based prediction methods, the proposed method is particularly effective in discovering knowledge in ordered event sequences even if noisy data are being dealt with. The method can be divided into three phases: (i) detection of underlying patterns in an ordered event sequence; (ii) construction of sequence-generation rules based on the detected patterns; and (iii) use of these rules to predict the attributes of future events. The method has been implemented in a program called OBSERVER-II, which has been tested with both simulated and real-life data. Experimental results indicate that it Is capable of discovering underlying patterns and explaining the behaviour of certain sequence-generation processes that are not obvious or easily understood. The performance of OBSERVER-II has been compared with that of existing AI-based prediction systems, and it is found to be able to successfully solve prediction problems programs such as SPARC have failed on	,Design engineering;Event detection;Laboratories;Learning systems;Phase detection;Prediction methods;Sorting;Systems engineering and theory;Testing;Vocabulary,inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence)AI-based prediction systems;OBSERVER-II;SPARC;ordered event sequences;probabilistic inductive prediction;sequence-generation rules;sequential patterns

1810	Reflection through Constraint Satisfaction		Logic Programming:The 11th International Conference	20120924	The need for expressing and using meta-level knowledge has been widely recognized in the AI literature. Meta-knowledge and meta-level reasoning are suitable, for example, for devising proof strategies in automated deduction systems, for controlling the inferencein problem solving, and for increasing the expressive power of knowledge representation languages. In order to carry out meta-level reasoning there must be a stated relationship between expressions at different levels, i.e., a reflection principle and a naming relation. We present a new mechanism [1] that allows us to model reflection principles in meta-level architectures. Such a mechanism is based on the integration of constraint satisfaction techniques into the inference process of such systems. We employ an abstract language and introduce the concept of a name theory for such a language. The semantics of a name theory is a name interpretation, which generalizes the name relation of other reflective formalisms. We present a reflective inference system that is parameterized with a name theory and whose semantics is expressed in terms of a name interpretation. This mechanism is completely general aud can be easily concretized for a family of metalogic languages. Relevant applications or the proposed formalization have been investigated in legal reasoning [2], in the context of communication-based reasoning, where the interaction among agents is based on communication acts, and in the context of analogical reasoning [3].								
1811	Proposal of interband tunneling structures with strained layers	Guoping Ru; Aizhen Li	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	A type of interband tunneling structure with strained layers is proposed. InxGa1-xSb/ InxAl1-xSb/InAs/InxAl1-xSb/InxGa1-xSb strained resonant interband tunneling structures are theoretically studied by calculating current-voltage characteristics using realistic band structure and making comparisons to analogous unstrained structures. The results show that the interband tunneling windows of strained structures can be expanded by the introduction of strain in the InAs quantum-well layer. With a wider interband tunneling window, the peak current density is enhanced due to the broader tunneling transmission spectrum and higher bias required for resonant interband tunneling. The peak current density is also examined as a function of InAs well width for different InAlSb barrier widths.

Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Existing computerized systems that support scheduling decisions for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS's) rely largely on knowledge acquired through rote learning for schedule generation. In a few instances, the systems also possess some ability to learn using deduction or supervised induction. We introduce a novel AI-based system for generating static schedules that makes heavy use of an unsupervised learning module in acquiring significant portions of the requisite problem processing knowledge. This scheduler pursues a hybrid schedule generation strategy wherein it effectively combines knowledge acquired via genetics-based unsupervised induction with rote-learned knowledge in generating high-quality schedules in an efficient manner. Through a series of experiments conducted on a randomly generated problem of practical complexity, we show that the hybrid scheduler strategy is viable, promising, and, worthy of more in-depth investigations	,Computer aided manufacturing;Flexible manufacturing systems;Hybrid power systems;Induction generators;Jacobian matrices;Job shop scheduling;Management information systems;Processor scheduling;Spread spectrum communication;Supervised learning,flexible manufacturing systems;knowledge based systems;production control;scheduling;unsupervised learningAI-based system;deduction;flexible manufacturing systems;genetics-based hybrid scheduler;genetics-based unsupervised induction;production control;production engineering computing;rote learning;static schedules generation;unsupervised learning module							
1821	Answer Sets and Constructive Logic, II: Extended Logic Programs and Related Nonmonotonic Formalisms		Logic Programming and Non-Monotonic Reasoning:Proceedings of the Second International Workshop 1993	20120924	We relate the answer set semantics for extended logic programs [6, 7] to constructive logics with strong negation, due to Nelson and others [15, 12, 2], By showing that the answer set semantics is, in a suitable sense, sound and complete with respect to the constructive logic N, we are justified in interpreting the rules of extended logic programs as formulas of N, in particular reading ﾑ?ﾒ as constructive implication and ﾑ?ﾒ or ﾑ?ﾒ as strong negation. In addition, we use this result to relate answer sets to two of the best-known nonmonotonic formalisms developed in AI, namely default theory and nonmonotonic modal logic. We show that answer sets correspond to extensions in the sense of a constructive default logic and to S4-expansions in the setting of nonmonotonic modal logic.

Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Most research into applying AI techniques to real-time control problems has limited the power of AI methods or embedded reactivity in an AI system. An alternative, cooperative architecture is presented. It uses separate AI and real-time subsystems to address the problems for which each is designed. A structured interface allows the subsystems to communicate without compromising their respective performance goals. By reasoning about its own bounded reactivity, cooperative intelligent real-time control architecture (CIRCA) can guarantee that it will meet hard deadlines while still using unpredictable AI methods. With its abilities to guarantee or trade off the timeliness, precision, confidence, and completeness of its output, CIRCA provides more flexible performance than previous systems	,Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Control systems;Cybernetics;Delay;Intelligent control;Real time systems;Testing,cooperative systems;inference mechanisms;intelligent control;real-time systemsAI techniques;CIRCA;bounded reactivity;cooperative intelligent control architecture;output completeness;real time systems;reasoning;structured interface

1828	Reasoning with Inconsistency in Extended Deductive Databases		Logic Programming and Non-Monotonic Reasoning:Proceedings of the Second International Workshop 1993	20120924	Extended deductive databases (XDBs) allow for negative conclusions in rules. So, the question of how to deal with contradictions in the database arises. The trivialization (or ﾑexplosionﾒ) approach of classical logic, according to which everything follows from a contradiction, is certainly not adequate for the purpose of processing partially inconsistent information in a cognitively and computationally satisfactory way. We propose to consider formalisms instead, which are close in spirit to defeasible inheritance systems known from the AI literature on nonmonotonic reasoning. In these systeiiis, contradictory pieces of information neutralize each other. We show that there are at least three different neutralization-based calculi for XDBs with varying degree of skepticism towards the reliability of possibly inconsistent information, called skeptical, conservative and credulous. They all constitute interesting options in database reasoning. We show that their implementation as a meta-interpreter in Prolog is straightforward.								
1829	A decision-theoretic framework for integrating sensors into AI plans	Abramson, B.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Strategic planners for robots that survive in a realistic environment must coordinate sensor acquisition with robotic activity. Sensory coordination is discussed as a decision problem. It is assumed that although relevant sensory data can generally be requested, costs prohibit many of these requests from being granted. The underlying question is whether a central controller should grant or deny a system's request for a sensory update. Given this fundamental problem, a decision-theoretic analysis is used to derive closed-form formulas for the appropriate frequency of sensor integration as a function of parameters of the equipment, the domain, and the types of errors from which the system must recover. The derived formulas give precise descriptions of the frequency with which sensory requests should be granted in a simplified, formalized setting. They also serve as a template into which a variety of real-world parameterizations could fit	,Artificial intelligence;Centralized control;Control systems;Costs;Frequency;Intelligent sensors;Problem-solving;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Sensor systems,decision theory;planning (artificial intelligence);robots;sensor fusionAI planning;artificial intelligence;closed-form formulas;decision theory;real-world parameterizations;robots;sensor acquisition;sensor fusion;sensory coordination							
1830	A strategic negotiations model with applications to an international crisis	Kraus, S.; Wilkenfeld, J.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The area of automated negotiation has been of particular interest in AI due to the important role negotiations play in facilitating understanding and the achievement of cooperation among entities with differing interests, whether they be individuals, organizations, governments, or automated agents. A strategic model for negotiation of alternative offers is presented with specific application to international crises. In the model, both players can opt out, and while one loses over time, the other gains (up to a point). Specific issues are: conflicting objectives and utility functions of parties and the impact of time on bargaining behavior in crises. The general model has relevance to the hostage crisis from which it was built, and subsequent applicability in building an automated negotiation agent for experimental and training purposes	,Analytical models;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Decision making;Environmental economics;Game theory;Government;Mathematics;Optimized production technology;Virtual prototyping,game theory;politicsAI;automated negotiation;automated negotiation agent;bargaining behavior;conflicting objectives;hostage crisis;international crisis;strategic negotiations model;utility functions							
1831	Modeling Adaptive Autonomous Agents	Maes, P	Artificial Life	20140519	One category of research in Artificial Life is concerned with modeling and building so-called adaptive autonomous agents, which are systems that inhabit a dynamic, unpredictable environment in which they try to satisfy a set of time-dependent goals or motivations. Agents are said to be adaptive if they improve their competence at dealing with these goals based on experience. Autonomous agents constitute a new approach to the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is highly inspired by biology, in particular ethology, the study of animal behavior. Research in autonomous agents has brought about a new wave of excitement into the field of AI. This paper reflects on the state of the art of this new approach. It attempts to extract its main ideas, evaluates what contributions have been made so far, and identifies its current limitations and open problems.	action selection;artificial creatures;autonomous agents;behavior-based artificial intelligence;learning from experience							
1832	Artificial intelligence in electric power systems: a survey of the Japanese industry	Rahman, S.	Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The author studied the Japanese involvement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and visited eight Japanese R&D laboratories, where he discussed the AI and expert system related activities in the power industry. A comprehensive look at the combined Japanese effort is provided. The current topics of interest are: AI and its application in power engineering; problems in AI applications development and their solutions; practical system examples; and AI applications to power systems of the future. Out of the 97 papers cited, ten were produced by electric utilities, ten by manufacturers, 17 by universities, and 60 were joint efforts. This shows the level and importance of joint collaborative research among the Japanese researchers. Even though they are working on many theoretical aspects of the AI technology, including automated knowledge acquisition and verification, they still use a significant amount of theoretical work done in the US for successful prototyping of AI based tools. The use of AI tools in the Japanese electric power industry is far more widespread than what is seen in the US or in Europe	,Artificial intelligence;Collaborative work;Educational institutions;Expert systems;Knowledge acquisition;Power engineering;Power industry;Power systems;Prototypes;Pulp manufacturing,artificial intelligence;power system analysis computing;research and development managementJapan;artificial intelligence;electric power systems

1834	Analysis of real-time rule-based systems with behavioral constraint assertions specified in Estella	Cheng, A.M.K.; Browne, J.C.; Mok, A.K.; Rwo-Hsi Wang	Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Rule-based expert systems are increasingly used to monitor and control the operations of complex real-time systems which require intensive knowledge-decision processing and human expertise. These embedded AI systems must respond to events in the rapidly changing external environment so that the results of the expert system's computation in each monitor-respond cycle are valid in safely operating the real-time system. Determining how fast an expert system can respond under all possible situations is a difficult problem. We have developed an efficient analysis methodology for a large class of rule-based EQL programs to determine whether a program in this class has bounded response time. In particular, we have identified several sets of primitive behavioral constraint assertions: an EQL program which satisfies all constraints in one of these sets of assertions is guaranteed to have bounded response time. Here, we enhance the applicability of our analysis technique by introducing a facility with which the rule-based programmer can specify application-specific knowledge that is too difficult to be mechanically detected in the new language Estella in order to determine the performance of an even wider range of programs. We also describe efficient algorithms for implementing the analysis tools	,Artificial intelligence;Control systems;Delay;Embedded computing;Expert systems;Humans;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Real time systems,constraint handling;expert systems;formal specification;knowledge representation;real-time systemsEstella;application-specific knowledge;behavioral constraint assertions;bounded response time;human expertise;knowledge-decision processing;monitor-respond cycle;real-time rule-based systems;rule-based expert systems;rule-based programmer

1839	Multi-auditor cooperation: a model of distributed reasoning	Chang, A.-M.; Bailey, A.D., Jr.; Whinston, A.B.	Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Management and analysis of complex systems frequently involves groups of managers and experts, each working on different parts of the system, cooperating and coordinating among themselves to manage and analyze the system as a whole. The authors propose a distributed reasoning approach to render this process of multiagent cooperation more efficient and effective. They consider, as an example of such a group process, the auditing process in assessing the reliability of an internal control system in which each auditor makes default assumptions about parts of the system being analyzed by other team members. The coordination process is modeled using an assumption-based truth maintenance system, which explicitly represents such assumptions, their possible retractions on subsequent contrary evidence, and changes in the auditor's terminal options. The ways in which the resolution of opinions among auditors can be achieved through a process of evidence sharing facilitated by the model are discussed	,Control system synthesis;Control systems;Couplings;Expert systems;Information systems;Knowledge based systems;Maintenance;Problem-solving;Prototypes;System testing,managementassumption-based truth maintenance system;auditors;complex systems;coordination;distributed reasoning;group process;internal control system;management;multiagent cooperation;reliability							
1840	Melt-grown p-type GaAs with iron doping	Tang, R&#x2010;S.; Saban, S.B.; Blakemore, J.S.; Gray, M.L.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Optical and electrical properties are described for bulk GaAs, grown from a melt doped with iron to create FeGa deep acceptors in a sufficient amount (exceeding the EL2 defect concentration) to make high-resistivity p-type rather than semi-insulating material. Both iron photoionization and EL2+ photoneutralization contribute to the near-infrared optical absorption. This made it possible to deduce the concentrations (NAi and NAn) of ionized and lattice-neutral iron, and the ratio (NAi/NAn). Temperature dependent measurements of dc electrical transport yielded quantities such as the free hole density, and hence the Fermi energy, for the 290ﾖ420 K range.

1841	Variational calculations of ground and higher states of metal-oxide-semiconductor inversion layer in a nonuniform electric field	Rao, M.; Rothwarf, A.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	We present variational calculations of the ground and higher-energy states for (100)Si metal-oxide-semiconductor inversion layers in the electric field induced by the gate voltage as represented by a recently proposed logarithmic potential. The ground-state energies are calculated in the electric quantum limit using the well-known FangﾖHoward trial wave function. The higher-energy states are obtained using a GramﾖSchmidt orthogonalization approach, beginning with trial wave functions that resemble the Laguerre functions. We compare our results with the standard triangular potential approximation involving the Ai(z) Airy function and its roots.

1843	Automated underground residential distribution design. I. Conceptual design	Sumic, Z.; Venkata, S.S.; Pistorese, T.	Power Delivery, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The design of the electrical supply system for new residential developments (electrical plat design) is considered. As an ill-structured and open-ended problem, the plat design is difficult to automate with conventional approaches. An additional complexity is imposed by the need to process spatial data such as circuits' maps, records, and construction plans. The intelligent decision support system for automated electrical plat design (IDSS for AEPD), an engineering tool aimed at automating plat design is presented. The IDSS for AEPD combines the functionality of a geographically referenced database with the sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) to deal with the complexity inherent in this type of problem.

1844	Oxygen-related centers in chemical vapor deposition of diamond	Ruan, J.; Choyke, W.J.; Kobashi, K.	Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Diamond films are grown using microwave-plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Some samples are deposited using 0.1% oxygen in the reaction gas mixture. We have measured the cathodoluminescence spectra of these diamond films (at 77 K) and found that there is a significant difference between the samples grown with oxygen and those without oxygen. Some of the impurity-related luminescence peaks are reduced in intensity or disappear when 0.1% oxygen is used. On the other hand, there are new spectral features in the films grown with oxygen. We attribute some of these new features to oxygen-related centers in diamond and conclude that oxygen could incorporate into the diamond lattice during the CVD process.

1851	Representing inference control by hypothesis-based association	Gao Ji	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	An approach for representing inference control is presented. It is proposed that the representation of inference control should consist of two levels: planning level which realizes problem solving strategies, and a performing level, which represents inference tactics. Based on this approach, the representation system hypothesis-based associative representation (HAR) has been developed to realize the functional architecture for knowledge-based systems. Because users are allowed to organize hypothesis-based associative networks that perform the problem solving strategies with different features, HAR becomes not only a tool for building knowledge-based systems, but also an environment for exploring AI techniques. For example, by comparing three strategies of block-world action planning, it is found that the least commitment strategy is the most efficient	,Artificial intelligence;Control systems;Engines;Humans;Inference mechanisms;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge management;Problem-solving;Strategic planning,inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;knowledge representationAI techniques;HAR;block-world action planning;functional architecture;hypothesis-based associative networks;inference control;inference tactics;knowledge-based systems;least commitment strategy;performing level;planning level;problem solving strategies;representation system hypothesis-based associative representation

1854	Tribological properties of polished diamond films	Bhushan, B.; Subramaniam, Vish V.; Malshe, Ajay; Gupta, B.K.; Ruan, Juai	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Despite the rapid progress being made in the synthesis of diamond films and recent interest in polishing of diamond films, no systematic measurements of friction and wear on polished diamond films have been reported. In the present study, chemomechanical and laser polishing techniques are used, and friction and wear data on the chemomechanically polished diamond films are presented. With the chemomechanical polishing technique used in this study, the rms roughness of hot filament chemical vapor deposited diamond films can be reduced from about 657 to about 170 nm with rounding off of sharp asperities with no change in the diamond structure. The polished films exhibit coefficient of friction (?0.1) and wear rates much lower than that of unpolished films. Friction and wear properties of the polished films are comparable to that of single-crystal natural diamond. Based on this study, it is concluded that polished films are potential candidates for tribological applications.

1855	Navigation templates: mediating qualitative guidance and quantitative control in mobile robots	Slack, M.G.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Navigation Templates, a set of tools for constructing flexible plans for a mobile robot's local navigation, is described. A Navigation Template-based plan for action is environment-relative. The plan places qualitative constraints on the robot's actions as a function of the robot's internal model of its surroundings. Because these constraints bound the robot's motions, rather than dictating a particular trajectory, the plan is able to flex with the robot's changing perceptions of the world. Quantitative actuator control is obtained through the use of a transformation function that maps the qualitative plan into a currently preferred direction of travel for the robot. The transformation is computationally inexpensive, allowing the quantitative control to be updated rapidly, thus keeping the robot's actions in step with the qualitative plan and its perceptions of the world. This work is implemented and running on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's planetary exploration mobile robot as well as MITRE's Denning mobile robot	,Actuators;Aircraft navigation;Bridges;Control systems;Mobile robots;Orbital robotics;Robot control;Robot kinematics;Robot motion;Robot sensing systems,mobile robots;navigation;path planningJPL planetary exploration robots;MITRE's Denning mobile robot;Navigation Templates;flexible path planning;mobile robots;qualitative guidance;quantitative control

An algorithm using an unsupervised/supervised learning concept and historical relationship between the load and temperature for a given season, day type and hour of the day to forecast hourly electric load with a lead time of 24 hours is proposed. An additional approach using functional link net, temperature variables, average load and last one-hour load of previous day is introduced and compared with the ANN model with one hidden layer load forecast. In spite of limited available weather variables (maximum, minimum and average temperature for the day) quite acceptable results have been achieved.

1860	Topological reasoning about dextrous grasps	Nguyen, T.N.; Stephanou, H.E.	IBM Journal of Research and Development	20100406	The need, in robot manipulation, for higher levels of dexterity and versatility than those provided by grippers and by special-purpose end-effectors has prompted much research effort during the last decade on the design and control of multifingered hands. Most work on multifingered robot hands has dealt with low-level, numeric control, commonly based on screw theory and tools drawn from line geometry, differential geometry, kinematics, and dynamics. Current numeric, contact-based schemes, however, are limited to tip prehension (intentional grasping by the fingertips). The intriguing ease with which humans perform grasping and manipulation activities has concurrently triggered new investigations to provide robots with humanlike, prehensile capability for complex tasks in unstructured environments. These investigations have resulted in numerous AI-oriented, task-directed, distributed, symbolic schemes that have been conducted essentially independently. Efforts to link symbolic and numeric schemes have been undertaken, but the results have been rather modest. This paper deals with an intelligent, integrated symbolic-numeric scheme for dextrous manipulation, using a topological approach. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning scheme called topological reasoning that is used in conjunction with a grasp-based, topological model for uniform representations of multifingered robot hands at different levels of detail (e.g., whole hand, finger, joint), and discuss its application to dextrous manipulation (grasp selection and regrasping). We show that using topological reasoning, both hand posture and hand functionality can be derived from symbolic, high-level task requirements and object attributes, and can be transformed into numeric, low-level, joint space variables. Furthermore, the reasoning scheme is applicable not only to tip prehension, but also to palm prehension and any combination of the two.

1871	Artificial intelligence in control: some myths, some fears but plenty prospects	Leitch, R.	Computing & Control Engineering Journal	20020806	It is argued that the development of artificial intelligence techniques is bringing about fundamental changes in the way we represent and reason about the physical world. From a control engineering perspective, such methods offer a significant extension of the available method for systems modelling, and hence open up exciting prospects for the diversification of control methods to other application areas, e.g. automated fault diagnosis, simulation and training. However, such diversification brings with it the need to clearly establish the principles, and hence the limitations, behind each technique. Accordingly, the author proposes a classification of system models in terms of their knowledge classes and characteristics, and relates these to existing approaches to the use of AI methods in control. Such a classification is a necessary precursor to developing a methodological approach to identifying the most appropriate technique for a given generic class of applications	artificial intelligence;control engineering computing;modellingAI methods;application areas;artificial intelligence techniques;automated fault diagnosis;control engineering perspective;control methods;knowledge classes;methodological approach;physical world;simulation;systems modelling;training							
1872	Excitonic line broadening in bulk grown Cd1-xZnxTe	Oettinger, K.; Hofmann, D.M.; Efros, Al.L.; Meyer, B.K.; Salk, M.; Benz, K.W.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Cd1-xZnxTe crystals grown by the traveling heater method have been investigated by low-temperature photoluminescence. The excitonic energy gap as a function of the alloy composition was determined over the complete range of x=0 to x=1. The composition dependent broadening of the neutral acceptor bound exciton (A 0X) line was determined. Theoretical calculations, where the A 0X exciton is treated within the pseudodonor model and the conduction/valence band offset between CdTe and ZnTe is taken into account, give close agreement with the experiment for x?0.77. Evidence for clustering of Zn atoms is found for x?0.77.

1873	Applications of Logicist Knowledge Representation to Enterprise Modelling		Enterprise Integration Modeling:Proceedings of the First International Conference	20120924	The goal of the enterprise modelling efforts at IBM is to develop methods to model an organizational unit's knowledge and activities. Ultimately, enterprise modelling should support an ongoing, incremental automation process. The problem we address here is the applicability of declarative AI knowledge representation (KR) to enterprise modelling. Does KR have a useful role to play? What is it? What are its limitations? In an initial case study in the area of purchasing, we find that much non-automated guidelines information can be represented successfully using standard logicist methods. We show how to create very-high-level specifications with well-understood semantics. These specifications are useful as descriptive information in non-executable form; they help identify ambiguities, inconsistencies, and omissions in less formal guidelines information. We also show that these very-high-level specifications are partially executable using standard logicist inference methods such as rule-based programming and/or logic programming. This is useful for development of prototype software and simulations. Our logicist approach provides a rich language and set of methods for describing and propagating constraints, especially when compared to other less formal approaches such as the Entity-Relationship model. However, we discover that most guidelines information relies heavily on common sense, and raises difficult knowledge representation challenges in temporal, default, decision-theoretic, and multiple-level reasoning that expose the limits of state-of-the-art logicist methods.								
1874	Applying case-based reasoning to autoclave loading	Hennessy, D.; Hinkle, D.	IEEE Expert	20020806	Clavier, a case-based reasoning system that determines the placement of parts made of composite materials in an autoclave, is described. The heating rate of all parts put in an autoclave must be controlled carefully, but their number, shape, and placement can cause significant nonlocal variations. Clavier provides interactive support, using cases to propose load configurations and multiload plans. One of its advantages is that it learns, becoming more competent as it acquires new cases. Clavier's structure and results from evaluations of Clavier as an application and as a case-based reasoning research tool are discussed.>	,Artificial intelligence;Composite materials;Curing;Engineering drawings;Heating;Knowledge acquisition;Libraries;Maintenance engineering;Ovens;Shape,case-based reasoning;convection;learning (artificial intelligence);materials science;physics computingClavier;autoclave;case-based reasoning research tool;case-based reasoning system;composite materials;interactive support;learns;load configurations;multiload plans;nonlocal variations

1877	Status report on the 12 T split coil test facility SULTAN [for NET magnets]	Blau, B.; Aebli, E.; Jakob, B.; Pasztor, G.; Vecsey, G.; della Corte, A.; Pasotti, G.; Sacchetti, N.; Spadoni, M.	Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The third phase of upgrading of the superconductor test facility SULTAN into a split coil system (SULTAN III) is in progress. SULTAN III consists of two coil packages, each containing three concentrically mounted superconducting solenoids. Together they will produce a field of nearly 12 T between the two coil packages, inside a solenoid bore of 58 cm. The outermost 6 T coils have NbTi conductors, whereas the inner 9 T and 12 T coils are made of A-15 cables. All Nb3Sn coils are manufactured by the react-and-wind technique. The split coil arrangement, in connection with a sophisticated sample insert containing a 50 kA superconducting transformer, will allow testing of short samples of high-current-carrying superconductors, e.g. for fusion applications. The sample insert was designed to allow changing the samples within a few hours without warming up the whole magnet system.

1880	On the ﾑﾑband-Aﾒﾒ emission and boron related luminescence in diamond	Ruan, J.; Kobashi, Koji; Choyke, W.J.	Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Cathodoluminescence spectra of undoped and boron-doped diamond films are reported and are compared with each other. The dominant spectra feature of these samples is the broad luminescence bands centered around 2.83 and 2.32 eV in undoped and relatively heavily doped samples, respectively. Our result indicates that the commonly observed 2.83 eV band (often called by the name ﾑﾑband-Aﾒﾒ) is neither related to boron nor to donor-acceptor pairs in diamond. From all of the available data, we conclude that the 2.32 eV band is due to boron related centers and the 2.83 eV band is due to dislocations in diamond.

1881	Aging study of nickel-copper-manganite negative temperature coefficient thermistors by thermopower measurements	Castelan, P.; Ai, Bui; Loubiere, I.; Rousset, A.; Legros, R.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Ceramic nickel-copper-manganite based negative temperature coefficient thermistors are unstable under thermal constraint, which increases the resistivity of these devices. This unstability can be reduced by the addition of a small amount of barium. These ceramics have a spinel structure, and the conduction takes place by a hopping process involving [Mn3+]/[Mn4+] octahedral ions. This study by the use of thermopower measurements points out that the resistivity change under thermal constraint is principally due to the disproportionation of [Mn3+]/[Mn4+] ions in the octahedral sites. Furthermore, it seems that some nickel ions migrate from octahedral to tetrahedral sites.

1889	A planning aid: an intelligent modeling system for planning problems based on constraint satisfaction	Raghunathan, S.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Constraint satisfaction problems have been extensively studied by researchers in both the operations research (OR) and artificial intelligence (AI) areas. The research aimed at integrating the two approaches so that some of their limitations can be removed is described. Specifically, a knowledge-based system that formulates and maintains OR models for manufacturing planning purposes is presented. Domain-specific knowledge allows synthesis of various qualitative relationships into mathematical relationships and its identification of various dependencies between symbolic and mathematical models. The modeler component engages in a search process to identify the simplest model that can be formulated. A truth maintenance system, specifically designed to support modeling for planning, allows the user to explore various scenarios to arrive at an appropriate plan. Preliminary experiments indicate that human planners are able to formulate models that are equivalent to those formulated by experienced OR modelers for various planning problems	,Art;Artificial intelligence;Genetics;Humans;Intelligent systems;Knowledge based systems;Mathematical model;Operations research;Process planning;Virtual manufacturing,artificial intelligence;constraint theory;knowledge based systems;manufacturing computer control;manufacturing data processing;operations researchartificial intelligence;constraint satisfaction;domain specific knowledge;intelligent modeling system;knowledge-based system;manufacturing planning;mathematical models;mathematical relationships;operations research;planning aid;planning problems;qualitative relationships;symbolic models;truth maintenance system							
1890	A multilayer perceptron solution to the match phase problem in rule-based artificial intelligence systems	Sartori, Michael A.; Passino, K.M.; Antsaklis, P.J.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	In rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) planning, expert, and learning systems, it is often the case that the left-hand-sides of the rules must be repeatedly compared to the contents of some working memory. Normally, the intent is to determine which rules are relevant to the current situation (i.e., to find the conflict set). A technique using a multilayer perceptron to solve the match phase problem for rule-based AI systems is presented. A syntax for premise formulas (i.e., the left-hand-sides of the rules) is defined, and working memory is specified. From this, it is shown how to construct a multilayer perceptron that finds all of the rules which can be executed for the current situation in working memory. The complexity of the constructed multilayer perceptron is derived in terms of the maximum number of nodes and the required number of layers. A method for reducing the number of layers to at most three is presented	,Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Engines;Expert systems;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Production systems,artificial intelligence;expert systems;learning systems;neural netsexpert systems;learning systems;match phase problem;multilayer perceptron solution;planning;rule-based artificial intelligence systems;working memory

1895	A class of self-healing ring architectures for SONET network applications	Tsong-Ho Wu; Lau, R.C.	Communications, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	A class of SONET-based self-healing ring (SHR) architectures and associated control schemes are reviewed. It is shown that the cost and capacity tradeoffs between bidirectional SHRs (B-SHRs) and unidirectional SHRs (U-SHRs) depend strongly upon the application, the network size and the demand pattern. An analysis of the impact on the SONET standard suggests that using automatic protection switching (APS) schemes with SONET SHR architectures requires a change of currently standardized SONET K1 and K2 overhead byte definitions and functionality. Alternatively, a simple distributed control scheme using path AIS avoids a change of the SONET standard in terms of K1 and K2 operations, and thus can be deployed on a timely basis and may ease intervendor compatibility problems. The selection of appropriate SONET SHR architectures depends upon the operating telephone companies' economic analysis, emphases on multivendor environment, SHR implementation time frame, and standards progress on making the change to support a bidirectional ring architecture	,Automatic control;Bandwidth;Costs;Environmental economics;Optical fiber cables;Optical fiber networks;Protection switching;Protocols;SONET;Telecommunication control,SONET;network topology;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication standardsSONET network applications;SONET standard;automatic protection switching;bidirectional rings;capacity tradeoffs;control schemes;cost;distributed control scheme;intervendor compatibility;network survivability;self-healing ring architectures;unidirectional rings							
1896	Expert capnogram analysis	Bao, W.; King, P.; Zheng, J.; Smith, B.E.	Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, IEEE	20020806	A real-time expert system that deciphers CO/sub 2/ waveforms (capnograms) is described. The Capnogram Analyzer Expert System (CAES) was designed using both traditional pattern-recognition methods and an artificial intelligence (AI) approach for signal description and classification. The pattern-recognition technique is used to extract features from the digitized CO/sub 2/ waveforms. The AI approach involves abstracting CO/sub 2/ waveforms from numeric representation to higher-level symbolic representation and a so-called reasoning step to analyze the symbolic data. The CAES consists of three essential components: segmentation, single breath cycle identification and waveform classification.

Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Diamond films were grown using microwave-plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Boron doping in these films were achieved by using 0ﾖ1 ppm diborane (B2H6) in the reaction gas mixture during the deposition process. Some samples were deposited using 0.1% oxygen in the reaction gas mixture. We have employed cathodoluminescence to analyze the deposited diamond films and found that the boron concentration in diamond films is significantly reduced when oxygen was used in the deposition. For example, our result indicates that the boron concentration in films doped with 1.0 ppm B2H6 with the addition of 0.1% oxygen is close to that of films doped with 0.01 ppm B2H6 without using oxygen. Therefore, the probability of boron incorporation in diamond films is reduced by a factor of roughly 100 when 0.1% oxygen is used compared with the case where no oxygen is used.

1902	Existence assumptions in knowledge representation		Knowledge Representation	20120924	If knowledge representation formalisms are to be suitable for semantic interpretation of natural language, they must be more adept with representations of existence and nonexistence than they presently are. Quantifiers must sometimes scope over non-existent entities. I review the philosophical background, including Anseim and Kant, and exhibit some ontological problems that natural language sentences pose for knowledge representation. The paraphrase methods of Russell and Quine are unable to deal with many of the problems. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of the RussellQuine ontology are reflected in most current knowledge representation formalisms in AI. Several alternatives are considered, including some intensional formalisms and the work of Hobbs, hut all have problems. Free logics and possible worlds don't help either. But useful insights are found in the Meinongian theory of Parsons, in hich a distinction between nuclear and exiranticlear kinds of predicates is made and used to define a universe over which quantification scopes. If this is combined with a naive ontology. with about eight distinct kinds of existence, a better approach to the representation of nonexistence can be developed within Hobbs' basic formalism

1904	Diagrammatic knowledge representation	Sen, T.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Diagrams are used to facilitate problem solving in engineering, physics, geology, and other scientific areas. Diagrams store related elements adjacents to each other. For instance, it can be easily seen from a map that Iowa and Illinois are adjacent states, since they are placed next to each other. A nondiagrammatic or sentential representation of the map would have this information explicitly coded. A sequential search of the sentential representation would lead to the conclusion that Iowa and Illinois are adjacent states. Typical problem representations in artificial intelligence (AI) applications require vast amounts of storage, and problem processing requires extensive time consuming searches through knowledge bases. It is shown that if adjacency properties of a diagram are captured using a suitable data structure, then the search effort required to reach a valid conclusion is reduced. Also, the storage requirements of a diagrammatic representation are less than that of an equivalent sentential representation	,Artificial intelligence;Bars;Joints;Knowledge representation;Pattern recognition;Problem-solving;Production;Skeleton;Solids;Testing,data structures;knowledge representationartificial intelligence;data structure;diagrammatic knowledge representation;storage requirements

1906	The dispersion of the refractive index of III-V semiconductors	Bi, Wengang; Aizhen Li	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	The refractive index dispersions of semiconductors at wavelengths longer than the fundamental absorption edge have been analyzed with a theoretical prediction which is based on a modification of the simplified models of the interband transitions by taking into account the contribution of the free-carrier absorptions to the index of refraction. This approach has been applied to III-V semiconductor compounds, and the results exhibit excellent agreement with the previously published experimental data over the entire range of wavelengths concerned, thus not only confirming the validity of the presented model, but also demonstrating the non-negligible role played by the free-carrier absorption on the dispersion of the refractive index of semiconductors at wavelengths longer than the intrinsic absorption edge.

Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the use of knowledge-based techniques for solving scheduling problems. The authors survey several existing intelligent planning and scheduling systems with the aim of providing a guide to the main AI techniques used. In view of the prevailing difference is usage of the terms planning and scheduling between AI and operations research (OR), a taxonomy of planning and scheduling problems is presented. The modeling of real world problems from closed deterministic worlds to complex real worlds is illustrated with a project scheduling example.

1909	Artificial intelligence and financial services	Pau, L.F.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The author surveys key requirements and specific design techniques for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the financial services industry. After discussing some of the fundamental challenges which the financial services industry presents for decision technology, the motivations for the use of AI are related to a number of typical applications, which are broadly categorized into suitable development and delivery environments and generic domain utilities required from shells or customized systems for that industry. Markets and trades are then shown to be well described in terms of knowledge representation and data structures, by object-oriented features embedded into logic programming environments. Conflict resolution strategies, preference aggregation and revealed beliefs are studied. A formal analysis of investment decision criteria is given. An example from currency risk management exemplifies this area.

1910	The role of artificial intelligence in understanding the strategic decision-making process	Spangler, W.E.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	A survey is given which focuses on research issues involving strategic planning and artificial intelligence (AI), including the nature of the formulation task, cognitive studies of strategic planners and computer-based support for strategic planning. The author reviews the research to date, and argues that, like traditional decision support systems (DSS) research, much of the potential for future research in this area lies in modeling the ill-structured, early stages of the strategic decision making process namely, the strategic intelligence analysis and the issue diagnosis. Therefore, he discusses a specific model-based approach to the study of these early stages. Research in artificial intelligence-including investigations into diagnosis and situation assessment, analogical reasoning, plan recognition, nonmonotonic reasoning and distributed intelligence, among others-can be used to build models of strategic decision making that help researchers in better understanding this traditionally unstructured activity	,Artificial intelligence;Decision making;Decision support systems;Diagnostic expert systems;Engineering management;Finance;Financial management;Intelligent systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Strategic planning,decision support systems;decision theory;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systemsanalogical reasoning;artificial intelligence;cognitive studies;computer-based support;decision support systems;distributed intelligence;formulation task;future research;issue diagnosis;model-based approach;nonmonotonic reasoning;plan recognition;research issues;situation assessment;strategic decision making process;strategic intelligence analysis;strategic planners;strategic planning

1913	Si impurity in chemical vapor deposited diamond films	Ruan, J.; Choyke, W.J.; Partlow, W.D.	Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Cathodoluminescence (CL) and annealing studies of microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond films were carried out. The annealing behavior of the 1.681 eV (737.4 nm) line in the CL spectra of CVD diamond films grown on Si substrates is compared with that of the GR1 spectral line (1.673 eV) of natural diamond. We determine that these two lines have different origins. The comparison of CL spectra of diamond films grown on different substrates shows that the 1.681 eV peak is due to Si impurity in CVD diamond films.

1914	The Animat Path to AI		From Animals to Animats:Proceedings of the First International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior	20120924	A research methodology is proposed for understanding intelligence through simulation of artificial animals (ﾓanimatsﾔ) in progressively more challenging environments while retaining characteristics of holism, pragmatism, perception, categorization, and adaptation that are often underrepresented in standard AI approaches to intelligence. It is suggested that basic elements of the methodology should include a theory/taxonomy of environments by which they can be ordered in difficultyﾗone is offeredﾗand a theory of animat efficiency It is also suggested that the methodology offers a new approach to the problem of perception.								
1915	Schemas for Prey-Catching in Frog and Toad		From Animals to Animats:Proceedings of the First International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior	20120924	This paper first outlines the methodology of schema theory (Arbib 1981), which integrates perception and action by decomposing an overall behavior into the interaction of functional, neurally explicable, units called schemas. It offers comparisons with other methodologies from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Brain Theory (BT), and reviews the RS (Robot Schema) language and the Arbib and House (1987) model of detour behavior in Rana computatrix which associates potential fields with objects ﾗ an attractant for the prey; arepulsor for the fencepost; and a forward field for the toad itself which are then combined to create more complex fields which determine the trajectory of the animal. However, rather than analyze detour behavior here, the remainder of the paper presents a schema-theoretic model for the decision-making mechanisms which control preY: catching behavior in frog and toad; the extension of the work to model predator-avoidance is discussed elsewhere. It thus contributes to Rana computatrix, an evolving set of models of anuran visuomotor coordination (e.g., Arbib 1987). Our new model of prey-catching is rooted in recent experimental data on the behavior of animals with and without brain lesions. These data motivate the model's use of independent processing of the different parameters that define the stimulus position (horizontal eccentricity, elevation and distance). The model, which emphasizes action generated by the concurrent activity of multiple motor schemas rather than the serial activity of such schemas, predict new behaviors for experimental test.								
1916	AI on Wall Street	Freedman, Roy S.	IEEE Expert	20020806	The question of why some Wall Street AI applications are successful while others fail is explored. The Wall Street problem domain is modeled from a knowledge-based perspective, and the environment is represented from both an object-oriented view and a process view. Both models demonstrate the complexity inherent in formally defining the Wall Street environment. Analytic and cognitive models of the Wall Street environment are discussed, focusing on the shortcomings of each approach. The use of a new type of intelligent tool, called a collaborative system, that combines analytic models, human judgment, and cognitive models is proposed.>	,Artificial intelligence;Expert systems;Gold;Helium;Humans;Information technology;Integrated circuit modeling;Loans and mortgages;Security;Stock markets,artificial intelligence;cognitive systems;financial data processing;knowledge based systemsWall Street;artificial intelligence;cognitive models;collaborative system;intelligent tool;knowledge-based perspective;object-oriented view

1918	User interface graphically improves generator AI diagnostics	Gray, R.F.; King, I.J.	Computer Applications in Power, IEEE	20020806	The Diagnostic Graphical User Interface (DGUI), installed at a large nuclear power plant in the midwestern United States, is described. Since 1988, the power plant has been using the Generator Artificial Intelligence Diagnostics (GenAID) system, which provides online diagnostic capability for the generator and generator auxiliaries through a plant data center and communication link to the diagnostic operations center. The graphical interface represents a significant improvement over existing technology by providing the power plant control room operator with the capability of interacting directly with the diagnostic system. Providing the operator with the key variables that support a diagnosis made by the expert system increases the operator's understanding and confidence in the diagnosis. Recommendations are provided by the system to guide operator actions. Trending capability is provided for operator-selectable sensor points.

1919	An investigation of the properties of cubic GaN grown on GaAs by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy	Strite, S.; Ruan, J.; Li, Z.; Salvador, A.; Chen, H.; Smith, David.J.; Choyke, W.J.; Morkoc, H.	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures	20090618	We present the first comprehensive investigation of the bulk properties, both optical and structural, of cubic GaN as grown by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy on vicinal (100) GaAs substrates. X-ray measurements determined the crystal structure of GaN/GaAs to be cubic with a lattice constant of 4.5 �. High resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed a high density of planar defects propagating along the GaN {111} planes. The majority of the defects originated from disordered regions at the GaN/GaAs interface. The optical properties of the films were investigated by cathodoluminescence which revealed a broad midgap peak as well as several sharp emission peaks just below the expected band gap. The data imply that the room temperature band gap of cubic GaN is approximately 3.45 eV.

Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Foetos is an expert system designed to interpret fetal biophysical profile, contraction stress test, and nonstress tests. Foetos was built using the knowledge engineering tool GENIE, which adopts a mixed frame- and rule-based approach to represent the clinical knowledge in the field. Foetos includes diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic structures based on heuristic interpretation of such tests and contextual structures which relate interpretation to the overall clinical picture. The results of initial retrospective and prospective program validation show a substantial level of agreement between Foetos' recommendations and clinical management. Interpretation of the results indicates that the obstetrical field could be an area of interest for the application of AI techniques.	,Artificial intelligence;Expert systems;Fetal heart rate;Fetus;Knowledge engineering;Medical expert systems;Physics;Signal processing;Stress;System testing,expert systems;medical computingGENIE;clinical knowledge;clinical management;contextual structures;contraction stress test;diagnosis;expert system;fetal assessment;fetal biophysical profile;heuristic interpretation;knowledge engineering tool;nonstress tests;obstetrical field;prognosis;therapyDiagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Expert Systems;Female;Fetal Monitoring;Humans;Mass Screening;Online Systems;Pregnancy;Software;User-Computer Interface							
1922	Autonomous Agents, AI and Chaos Theory		From Animals to Animats:Proceedings of the First International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior	20120924	Agent theory in AI and related disciplines deals with the structure and behaviour of autonomous, intelligent systems, capable of adaptive action to pursue their interests. In this paper it is proposed that a natural reinterpretation of agent-theoretic intentional concepts like knowing, wanting, liking, etc., can be found in process dynamics. This reinterpretation of agent theory serves two purposes. On the one hand we gain a well established mathematical theory which can be used as the formal mathematical interpretation (semantics) of the abstract agent theory. On the other hand, since process dynamics is a theory that can also be applied to physical systems of various kinds, we gain an implementation route for the construction of artificial agents as bundles of processes in machines. The paper is intended asa basis for dialogue with workers in dynamics, AI, ethology and cognitive science.								
1923	Low frequency and low temperature behavior of ZnO-based varistor by ac impedance measurements	Al Abdullah, K.; Bui, A.; Loubiere, I.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	This paper reports on an original work on the study of the behavior of ZnO-based varistor by ac impedance measurements. The measurements of complex impedance response to small ac signals applied to samples have been achieved in the frequency range 10-3�7�106 Hz and a temperature range -196�145 �C. In the temperature range below -120�10 �C, a complete semicircular relaxation phenomenon has been observed, which is in good agreement with the Debye model. In the temperature range above -120�10 �C, the appearance of the depression angle ? may arise from the heterogeneity of the barriers of the ceramic varistor. A Cole�Cole distribution function of the relaxation time constants was used to characterize the response of the ceramic device as a function of temperature. No observable influence in the response was introduced by either the space charge or the electrode. Using the leakage resistance measurements from the complex plane, two values of the activation energies were observed; 0.36�0.02 eV and 0.01�0.001 eV. Similarly, the boundary layer equivalent capacitance measurements detect two other energy levels: 0.06�0.005 eV and about 0 eV.

1926	Artificial intelligence: where has it been, and where is it going?	Simon, H.A.	Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The directions for near-future development of artificial intelligence (AI) can be described in terms of four dichotomies: the use of reasoning versus the use of knowledge; the roles of parallel and of serial systems; systems that perform and systems that learn to perform; and programming languages derived from the search metaphor versus languages derived from the logical reasoning metaphor. Although the author believes that there are reasons for emphasizing knowledge systems (production systems) that are serial, capable of expert performance, and designed in terms of the search metaphor, the other pathways are also important and should not be ignored. In particular, empirical work is needed in the construction and empirical testing of the performance of large systems to explore all of these branching pathways	,Artificial intelligence;Cognitive science;Computer languages;Conference management;Expert systems;Humans;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge management;Machine intelligence;Production systems,inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;search problemsartificial intelligence;branching pathways;empirical testing;empirical work;expert performance;knowledge systems;large systems;logical reasoning metaphor;near-future development;production systems;programming languages;search metaphor;serial systems							
1927	Associative ionization and dissociative recombination in mercury vapor	Majetich, Sara; Tomczyk, Carol A.; Wiesenfeld, John R.

1928	AI in design: searching for differential relay protection	Hayes, R.M.	Computer Applications in Power, IEEE	20020806	A generic design process that uses computer-aided, constraint-directed searches is outlined. The process is described as a search over a state space that holds all possible combinations of values of state variables representing facets of the design process; i.e. it holds all complete designs. The use of intelligent search to reduce the amount of effort and the role of the human navigator are discussed. By combination of directed iteration and pruning, the designer reduces the number of complete designs that must be evaluated. Differential relay setting is then considered as a computerized constraint-directed search problem. The differential relay setter algorithm attempts to limit the number of improvements available at each node of the search tree, reduce the difficulty in finding the best node in a large tree, eliminate loops, and allow more than one acceptable design to be found and cataloged. An application of the algorithm is described.>	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Design automation;Heart;Navigation;Process design;Protection;Protective relaying;State-space methods;Testing,artificial intelligence;power engineering computing;relay protectionalgorithm;artificial intelligence;computer-aided;constraint-directed searches;differential relay protection;directed iteration;relay setting;search tree							
1929	Aging of zinc oxide varistors subjected to partial discharges in sulfur hexafluoride	Bui, A.; Khedim, A.; Loubiere, A.; Kourdi, M.B.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	The behavior of zinc oxide varistors subject to partial discharges in sulfur hexafluoride is studied with respect to their protective coating (glass and epoxy resin). Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is used as an insulating medium for the electrical equipment because of its high dielectric strength and good heat transfer properties. The decomposition of SF6 and residual impurities can considerably influence the varistor current-voltage characteristics essentially in the ohmic region. An analysis of the phenomenon shows that the degradation is due to a conducting deposit around the varistors and a physical corrosion of the coating.

1930	Dependence of magnetoresistive head readback characteristics on sensor height	Wallash, A.; Salo, M.; Lee, J.K.; Heim, D.; Garfunkel, G.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	The microtrack profile and bias point of a magnetoresistive (MR) head play a fundamental role in determining the full track response. In this paper the stripe height dependence of these properties is studied. The magnetic center of the MR head is found to approach the physical center, and microtrack side slopes become steeper and more equal as the stripe height is decreased. These experimentally observed trends can be understood using a simple model based on anisotropic flux propagation in the MR sensor.

Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Partial global planning is used to provide a framework for coordinating multiple AI systems that are cooperating in a distributed sensor network. By combining a variety of coordination techniques into a single, unifying framework, partial global planning enables separate AI systems to reason about their roles and responsibilities as part of group problem solving, and to modify their planned processing and communication actions to act as a more coherent team. Partial global planning is uniquely suited for coordinating systems that are working in continuous, dynamic, and unpredictable domains because it interleaves coordination with action and allows systems to make effective decisions despite incomplete and possibly obsolete information about network activity. The authors implement and evaluate partial global planning in a simulated vehicle monitoring application and identifying promising extensions to the framework	,Artificial intelligence;Condition monitoring;Contracts;Fuses;Process planning;Sensor fusion;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Sensor systems and applications;Vehicles,artificial intelligence;navigation;planning (artificial intelligence);problem solvingartificial intelligence;coordinating systems;group problem solving;multiple AI systems;partial global planning;vehicle monitoring							
1932	Removing the quantization error by repeated observation [image processing]	Ai, C.; Guoxiang, A.	Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	An image processing method, which can reduce the quantization error by averaging a set of measures performed on a relatively stable signal, is introduced. The use of noise that may be contaminating the signal or the addition of sawtooth wave function previous to quantization are the keys to this method. Also, averaging a signal corrupted by `natural' noise may decrease not only the error due to the noise but the quantization error as well. This method can be used to achieve high precision results which could not be achieved by A/D converters with more bits. The results of computer simulated experiments for this method are discussed	,Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Extraterrestrial measurements;Gaussian distribution;Image processing;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic noise;Pollution measurement;Quantization;White noise,error analysis;picture processingcomputer simulated experiments;image processing;noise;quantization error;sawtooth wave function;signal averaging							
1933	Cathodoluminescence and annealing study of plasma-deposited polycrystalline diamond films	Ruan, J.; Choyke, W.J.; Partlow, William D.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	We have measured the cathodoluminescence spectra of microwave plasma-assisted chemical-vapor deposited (CVD) polycrystalline diamond films at 77 K over the spectral range of 2300�8000 �. Annealing studies of these spectra have been carried out at 500, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1350 �C. Rich spectra are observed. Many of them are stable up to the highest annealing temperature. Two peaks at 3.188 and 2.638 eV and the 5RL lines are destroyed, while other lines at 3.57 and 3.462 eV appear, after a 1200 �C anneal. The two neighboring peaks at 2.330 and 2.320 eV are probably responsible for the broadness of the often observed peak at 2.328 eV in CVD diamond films. We also compare some of the annealing behavior of the CVD diamond films with those of natural single-crystal diamond, and conclude that while most of the annealing characteristics of plasma-deposited diamond films are similar with those which have been reported for single-crystal natural diamonds, some of the annealing behaviors are different for these two types of materials.

1934	Laser plasma x-ray emission studies using a pinhole transmission grating spectrometer	Wang, Xiaofang; Chen, Shisheng; Zhizhan Xu; Pachtman, A.; Li, Yaoling; Qian, Aidi	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	The powerful diagnostic capabilities of the pinhole transmission grating spectrometer (PTGS) have been utilized in studying laser plasma soft x-ray (SXR) emission and the following results are presented: (1) Studies of the SXR emission from C, Al, SiO2, Cu, Se, Mo, Sn, Er, W, and Au targets irradiated by a 1.06-?m laser beam with average power density 5�1014 W/cm2 and 300 ps duration indicate the strong dependence of the SXR emission on the atomic number Z. (2) Comparative experiments of Al or Au plasma SXR emission show that changes of the laser intensity have a more remarkable influence on low-Z plasma SXR emission than on high Z�s. (3) Experiments on target configurations (foil, multilayer, and half-cylindrical-groove target) reveal that the foil target is least effective for short-wavelength SXR emission, while the half-cylindrical target not only converges the plasma in the groove region, but also most effectively enhances the short-wavelength SXR emission or increases the electron temperature therein. (4) The PTGS is also complementarily used with the grazing incidence grating spectrograph in the SXR lasing experiments to determine the essential parameters of the line-focused laser-produced plasmas.

1935	Formation of PtSi-contacted p+n shallow junctions by BF+2 implantation and low-temperature furnace annealing	Tsui, Bing-Yue; Tsai, Jiunn&#x2010;Yann; Chen, Mao-Chieh	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	This work investigates the characteristics of PtSi-silicided p+n shallow junctions fabricated by implanting BF+2 ions into either the Pt/Si (ITM scheme) or the PtSi/Si (ITS scheme) structure followed by annealing in N2 furnace at temperatures from 650 to 800 �C. For a structure with Pt film of 30 nm thickness or PtSi film of 60 nm thickness, the implantation energy ranges from 40 to 80 keV with a dose ranging from 1�1015 to 1�1016 cm-2. For the ITS samples with BF+2 implantation at 40 keV, all ions are confined in the PtSi layer; therefore, only a modified Schottky junction is formed by the diffusion of boron atoms from the PtSi film during the annealing. The junction depth may be as shallow as 30 nm from the PtSi/Si interface. A complete p+n junction is formed for the ITM samples with implantation at 40 keV as well as all the samples implanted at 80 keV. The junction thus obtained has a forward ideality factor lower than 1.02 and a reverse current density less than 0.2 nA/cm2 at -5 V. Activation energy measurement indicates that most of the implantation damages have been recovered after annealing at a temperature as low as 700 �C. The reverse area and peripheral leakage current density are separated by measuring diodes of different perimeter/area ratio. For good samples, the reverse peripheral current comes from the surface generation current within the depletion region underneath the field oxide. All of the experimental results reveal that either Pt or PtSi film can be employed as an efficient barrier film in the ITM/ITS technique to form excellent and ultrashallow junctions with a low thermal budget.

1936	Intelligent monitoring and control of semiconductor manufacturing equipment	Murdock, J.L.; Hayes-Roth, B.	IEEE Expert	20020806	The use of AI methods to monitor and control semiconductor fabrication in a state-of-the-art manufacturing environment called the Rapid Thermal Multiprocessor is described. Semiconductor fabrication involves many complex processing steps with limited opportunities to measure process and product properties. By applying additional process and product knowledge to that limited data, AI methods augment classical control methods by detecting abnormalities and trends, predicting failures, diagnosing, planning corrective action sequences, explaining diagnoses or predictions, and reacting to anomalous conditions that classical control systems typically would not correct. Research methodology and issues are discussed, and two diagnosis scenarios are examined.>	,Artificial intelligence;CMOS process;Circuit testing;Conducting materials;Intelligent control;Manufacturing processes;Monitoring;Semiconductor device manufacture;Silicon;Temperature,computerised monitoring;knowledge based systems;manufacturing computer control;semiconductor device manufactureAI methods;Rapid Thermal Multiprocessor;abnormalities;anomalous conditions;corrective action sequences;explaining diagnoses;intelligent control;monitoring;predicting failures;process knowledge;product knowledge;semiconductor fabrication;semiconductor manufacturing equipment;trends							
1937	Distributed artificial intelligence approach to air traffic control	Findler, N.V.; Lo, R.	Control Theory and Applications, IEE Proceedings D	20020806	The idea of distributed planning and problem solving as a reliable and effective methodology for air traffic control is introduced. Some basic concepts and terminology of distributed planning are first discussed, then a novel coordinator-coworker structure is described; this is a control mechanism that can dynamically reorganise the planning system in response to the task at hand. The information structure supporting such a control mechanism is made up of hierarchically organised distributed scratch pads. It also provides the basis for `self-repairing' when individual nodes fail to operate, and allows for a graceful degradation of the whole system. The problems of air traffic control are analysed and the kernel design of the airborne processors in a location-centered co-operative planning system is described. The simulation-based planning process and its timing and selection considerations are explained. Three different organisational structures are implemented. The distributed air traffic control testbed is then introduced, and performance measures of the three organisational structures are compared in it. Finally, the design and the results of a series of experiments performed are discussed	air traffic computer control;artificial intelligence;fault tolerant computing;planning (artificial intelligence)AI;air traffic control;airborne processors;coordinator-coworker structure;distributed artificial intelligence;distributed planning;organisational structures							
1938	A user friendly software environment for protocol synthesis	Shiratori, N.; Yao-Xue Zhang; Takahashi, K.; Noguchi, S.	Computers, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	An attempt is made to design a user-friendly software environment for protocol synthesis based on the FSM (finite state machine), and to show the validity of applying AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to the construction of such a system. For that purpose, the authors have first designed a user-friendly software environment, named SEPS, using the programming language C, which belongs to the procedural programming paradigm. The aim of SEPS is to help a protocol designer to easily design a protocol and avoid logical errors like unspecified receptions and state deadlocks. In order to enhance the productivity of protocol development, a user-friendly interface has been designed which employs the multiwindow mechanism and provides the graphic tools in this system. Consequently, a protocol designer without any experience in protocol synthesis can easily design a protocol without logical errors. The authors have also designed a knowledge-based software environment for protocol synthesis, named KSPS, using the expert system tool OPS83. KSPS has the same functions as SEPS. The advantages of KSPS over SEPS in terms of extension, modification, and maintenance of protocol development systems are shown	,Artificial intelligence;Automata;Computer languages;Expert systems;Graphics;Productivity;Protocols;Software design;Software tools;System recovery,artificial intelligence;finite automata;knowledge based systems;programming environments;protocols;user interfacesKSPS;SEPS;artificial intelligence;deadlocks;expert system tool OPS83;finite state machine;graphic tools;knowledge-based software environment;multiwindow mechanism;procedural programming paradigm;programming language C;protocol synthesis;user friendly software environment;user-friendly interface							
1939	Reasoning about knowledge to understand distributed AI systems	Mazer, M.S.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The use of reasoning about agent knowledge to understand computation in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) systems is explored. In particular, the negotiation model and the blackboard model are examined, using a temporal, epistemic logic to characterize knowledge and its evolution among interacting agents in these systems. For negotiation, knowledge that agents require to commit consistently to the outcome is determined; also derived are communication requirements for attaining that knowledge in several computational settings. For the blackboard model, the kinds of knowledge statements that can be built up via communication during a distributed computation, independent of the application domain, is discussed. It is suggested that reasoning about knowledge can help one to understand the role of communication in achieving coherence and coordination.

It is found that the spatial nonuniformity of SXR emissions and ion turbulence occur during optical laserﾒs heating. Various instabilities can be excited due to the long scale length in line-shaped plasmas to produce the phenomenon.

1941	Control of Neuronal Output by Inhibition at the Axon Initial Segment	Douglas, R; Martin, K	Neural Computation	20140519	We examine the effect of inhibition on the axon initial segment (AIS) by the chandelier (ﾓaxoaxonicﾔ) cells, using a simplified compartmental model of actual pyramidal neurons from cat visual cortex. We show that within generally accepted ranges, inhibition at the AIS cannot completely prevent action potential discharge: only small amounts of excitatory synaptic current can be inhibited. Moderate amounts of excitatory current always result in action potential discharge, despite AIS inhibition. Inhibition of the somadendrite by basket cells enhances the effect of AIS inhibition and vice versa. Thus the axoaxonic cells may act synergistically with basket cells: the AIS inhibition increases the threshold for action potential discharge, the basket cells then control the suprathreshold discharge.								
1942	Formation of 0.1-?m n+p junction by As+ implantation through Pt or PtSi film	Tsui, Bing-Yue; Chen, Mao-Chieh	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Shallow silicided n+p junctions have been formed by implanting arsenic ions into Pt or PtSi films followed by low-temperature furnace annealing in the N2 ambient. Shallow junction diodes with a junction depth of about 0.1 ?m, a forward ideality factor lower than 1.02, and a reverse leakage current density less than 5 nA/cm2 at -5 V was achieved with 750 ﾰC, 90-min annealing. Annealing at higher temperatures results in junction degradation due to Pt diffusion from PtSi into the Si substrate. This may be significantly improved by F+ implantation following the As+ implantation. The shallow junction processed with the As+/F+ dual implantation and a subsequent anneal at 800 ﾰC shows even slightly better characteristics than those annealed at 750 ﾰC without F+ implantation.

1944	Formation and characterization of a PtSi contacted n+p shallow junction	Tsui, Bing-Yue; Chen, Mao-Chieh	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Ion implantation through metal (ITM) or metal silicide (ITS) appears to be an attractive technique for self-aligned silicided shallow junction formation. Since most of the implanted ions are confined in the barrier film, the damage generated in the silicon substrate is reduced and so is the required post-implant annealing temperature. The purpose of this work is to study the capability of using Pt and PtSi in the ITM/ITS technique. As+ ions were implanted through 30-nm Pt or 60-nm PtSi at 80 keV with doses ranging from 1�1015 to 1�1016 cm-2. The implanted samples were annealed from 650 to 800 �C. Junction depths measured by spreading resistance and secondary-ion mass spectroscopy on 750 �C annealed samples are about 0.11 and 0.13 ?m for the ITS and ITM schemes, respectively. The reverse area and peripheral leakage current density (JRA and JRP) are separated by measuring diodes of different size. All samples with a dose of 1�1015 cm-2 failed due to an insufficient amount of dopants which were incorporated into Si. For a dosage greater than 5�1015 cm-2, the JRA at -5 V is less than 0.2 nA/cm2 and the forward ideality factor is lower than 1.02 for the ITS samples annealed at 750 �C. Activation energy measurement shows that the JRA is diffusion-component dominated while the JRP is generation-component dominated at room temperature. Surface generation current and lateral implantation damage-induced current are examined and discussed in detail. A possible reason is that the lateral junction depth is less than the vertical junction depth and the depletion region may be extended to near the PtSi/Si interface. Annealing at 800 �C degrades the junction characteristics because - the Pt from PtSi diffuses into the junction region. Based on the experimental results and analysis we conclude that either Pt or PtSi film can be employed as an efficient barrier film in the ITM/ITS technique. A high-quality and ultrashallow junction can be fabricated using furnace annealing at temperature as low as 750 �C. The peripheral current generated at the silicide/silicon interface dominates the reverse junction current and cannot be avoided for the silicided junction with a junction depth less than 50 nm from the interface. This factor acts as a physical limitation as the junction depth scales down.

1945	A methodology for evaluating potential KBS applications	Laufmann, S.C.; DeVaney, D.M.; Whiting, M.A.	IEEE Expert	20020806	The AI literature contains a number of important references related to the selection of appropriate domains or problems for the application of knowledge-based-system (KBS) technology. The authors extend that previous work by identifying common principles related to selecting appropriate KBS applications. The principles are organized into a methodology for qualitatively analyzing the applicability of KBS technologies to specific problems within specific organizational environments. The principles can be used by individuals with varying levels of technical expertise in applying KBS technologies. Managers can use this procedure prior to discussing potential applications with their development staff, and technical development staff members can use to make it a detailed assessment of the salient issues for a given application. The methodology is divided into two levels of analysis, roughly corresponding to these two types of users. The authors describe the approach and directions for using the procedure. A complete scoring worksheet is included. After presenting the core of the procedure for each level of analysis, the authors explain how to score and interpret results and plan the direction for the next steps to be taken in a KBS development effort. The utility of this methodology is assessed.>	,Appropriate technology;Artificial intelligence;Expert systems;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge management;Laboratories;Probes;Problem-solving;Programming profession,knowledge based systems;software selectionAI literature;knowledge-based-system;potential KBS applications;scoring worksheet;technical expertise

1947	Cryogenic cathodoluminescence of plasma-deposited polycrystalline diamond coatings	Partlow, William D.; Ruan, Juai; Witkowski, Robert E.; Choyke, W.J.; Knight, Diane S.	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	The cathodoluminescence spectra of microwave plasma-deposited polycrystalline diamond films have been measured at liquid-nitrogen temperatures over the spectral region of 230ﾖ800 nm. The diamond coatings had been deposited under several different deposition temperatures and reactant compositions. Measurements on natural type-IIB diamond crystals were made for comparison. The intrinsic exciton emission bands which fall in the UV just below the band edge were observed, as well as several defect and impurity bands which extend throughout the visible part of the spectrum. SEM micrographs and Raman spectra were obtained for the same set of samples used for the cathodoluminescence measurements. It was found that the diamond-related cathodoluminescence features were most intense in samples whose Raman spectra exhibited the most intense cubic diamond line at 1332 cm-1 and the least intense graphitic band at about 1500 cm-1.

For the PtSi films that received F+ implantation, the film characteristics remain unchanged even after annealing at 800 ﾰC for 90 min, while for those without F+ implantation, the film properties begin to degrade after annealing at 750 ﾰC as observed by scanning electron microscopic inspection, Auger electron spectroscopy analysis, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy analysis, and sheet resistance measurement. The secondary ion mass spectroscopy analysis indicates that the fluorine atoms are segregated to the PtSi/Si interface. A fluorine barrier model is proposed to explain the absence of Pt in-diffusion induced deterioration for the F+-implanted PtSi film.

1949	A distributed intelligence methodology for railway traffic control	Vernazza, G.; Zunino, R.	Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	A distributed approach to railway traffic control is described. The approach overcomes the upper bounds imposed on the size of controlled areas by the requirement for real-time processing when centralized methodologies are applied. The control problem is modeled in terms of resource allocation tasks, and the concept of priority is generalized to rule local control decisions. The analysis of a global network's behavior, as derived from the integration of local microdecisions, prefigures a depletion effect which will protect the system from traffic jam collapses.

1950	Effect of nucleation mechanism on planar defects in InAs on Si (100)	Choi, C.&#x2010;H.; Hultman, L.; Ai, R.; Barnett, S.A.	Applied Physics Letters	20090618	Suppression of three-dimensional (3D) island nucleation during growth of InAs on Si (100), achieved by using very low energy, high-flux Ar ion irradiation, reduced planar defect densities. For 13 eV ion irradiation, 3D islands nucleated after ?2 monolayers (ML) of deposition, similar to conventional molecular beam epitaxy. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies of nominally 18-ML-thick films showed 3D InAs islands with {111} facets. A high density of {111} twins and stacking faults was observed adjacent to many of the {111} facets. Most of these defects propagated into the film upon further growth. When nucleation was carried out with 28 eV ion irradiation, flat InAs films were observed for thicknesses up to ?10 ML. The 3D islands that nucleated at higher thicknesses were flatter with less faceting than in the 13 eV case. The density of planar defects in the initial nucleation layer and in thicker InAs films was reduced when 3D island nucleation was suppressed. These results indicate that planar defects formed directly on the {111} facets of the 3D islands.

1953	Clever computers-why should engineers use AI?	Chung, P.; Inder, R.	IEE Review	20020806	Interest in AI began in the 1950s, when it was realised that the computer could be used to simulate theories of mental processes. Because it can accurately reveal the true implications of such complex theories, the computer is a valuable tool for furthering our understanding of human thought processes and perhaps of intelligence itself. Work done under the AI banner can be grouped very roughly into two areas: those aspects concerned with interaction with the world, and what might be termed higher mental functions. The former includes vision, speech perception, sonar interpretation, speech generation and robotics. Here, the authors focus on the higher functions: such activities as playing chess, planning, proving theorems and solving problems	artificial intelligence;engineering computing;knowledge based systemsAI;engineering computing;human thought processes;knowledge-based systems;mental functions;mental processes

1957	Growth of AlN/GaN layered structures by gas source molecular-beam epitaxy	Sitar, Z.; Paisley, M.J.; Yan, B.; Ruan, J.; Choyke, W.J.; Davis, R.F.	Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures	20090618	AlN/GaN layered structures with layer periods between 1.5 and 40 nm have been grown on (0001) oriented sapphire and ?(6H)-SiC substrates. The growth was performed using a modified gas source molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Standard effusion cells were used as sources of Al and Ga, and a small, MBE compatible, electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma source was used to activate nitrogen gas prior to deposition. Chemical analysis of the layers was conducted using Auger spectrometry. X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) were employed for the structural and microstructural studies. Coherent interfaces (no relaxation by misfit dislocations) were observed for bilayer periods smaller than 6 nm. By contrast, completely relaxed individual layers of GaN and AlN with respect to each other were present for bilayer periods above 20 nm. Cathodoluminescence showed a shift in the emission peak from 3.42 eV for the sample with individual 10-nm thick GaN wells and AlN barriers to 4.11 eV for the sample having 1-nm thick individual layers.

Oceanic Engineering, IEEE Journal of	20020806	The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is constructing a small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with an onboard mission control computer. The mission controller software for this vehicle is a knowledge-based artificial intelligence (AI) system requiring thorough analysis and testing before the AUV is operational. The manner in which rapid prototyping of this software has been demonstrated by developing a controller code on a LISP machine and using an Ethernet link with a graphics workstation to simulate the controller's environment is discussed. The development of a testing simulator using a knowledge engineering environment (KEE) expert system shell that examines AUV controller subsystems and vehicle models before integrating them with the full AUV for its test environment missions is discussed.

1960	GM-Learn: an iterative learning algorithm for CMOS gate matrix layout	Sao-Jie Chen; Yu Hen Hu	Computers and Digital Techniques, IEE Proceedings E	20050502	An iterative CMOS gate matrix layout algorithm utilising artificial intelligence (A.I.) learning techniques is proposed. This algorithm called GM-Learn, features a rudimentary learning mechanism which enables iterative improvements of the quality of a gate matrix layout. This accomplished through the repetitive applications of a one-pass gate matrix layout algorithm, called GM-Plan, to realise a given circuit specification. The function of GM-Learn, is then to 'learn' to modify the heuristics used in GM-Plan based on the previous trials. Two AI learning paradigms, known as rote learning and learning by parameter adjustment, are employed. These learning techniques enable GM-Learn to modify its heuristic search parameters based on information obtained from previous iterations. Benchmark test results indicate that this novel algorithm is able to produce a high quality gate matrix layout in only a few iterations. The significance of this new method is that it may be applicable to other combinatorial VLSI physical design problems where heuristic guided search is required.

1961	Causal Model Progressions as a Foundation for Intelligent Learning Environments		Artificial Intelligence and Learning Environments	20120924	AI research in qualitative modeling makes possible new approaches to teaching people about science and technology. We are exploring the implications of this work for the design of intelligent learning environments. The domain of application is electrical circuits, but the approach can be generalized to other subjects. Our prototype instructional system is based upon a progression of qualitative models of electrical circuit behavior. These models enable the system to simulate circuit behavior and to generate causal explanations. They also serve as target mental models for the learner. The model progression is used lo create problem sets that motivate successive refinements to the students' mental models. Acquisition of these models allows students, at all stages of learning, to solve interesting problems, such as circuit design and troubleshooting problems. The system enables students to employ different learning strategies and to manage their own learning. For instance, they can create and experiment with circuits, can attempt problems posed by the system, and can ask for feedback and coaching from the models. In pilot trials, the learning environment successfully taught novices to troubleshoot and to mentally simulate circuit behavior

1963	Unsupervised credit assignment in knowledge-based sensor fusion systems	Antonisse, H.J.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Validating knowledge for sensor fusion systems is intrinsically problematic. Knowledge evaluation in this context is viewed as an unsupervised credit assignment problem. An approach to dynamic knowledge evaluation based on a credit assignment algorithm called the bucket brigade is explored. The performance of individual elements of knowledge in rule-based systems is incrementally assessed (credit is assigned) in the conflict resolution phase of the system's operation. A formulation is developed that avoids the requirement for supervision, leading to dynamic knowledge evaluation that is not dependent on externally derived system critiques. Finally, the mechanism is extended to apportion credit to input sources as well as elements in the system's knowledge base	,Artificial intelligence;Data security;Force sensors;Intelligent sensors;Intelligent structures;Knowledge based systems;Sensor fusion;Supervised learning;Testing,decision support systems;knowledge based systems;knowledge engineeringbucket brigade;knowledge based systems;knowledge evaluation;rule-based systems;sensor fusion systems;unsupervised credit assignment

1966	Blondie-III	van Liempd, G.; Velthuijsen, H.; Florescu, A.	IEEE Expert	20020806	A distributed blackboard implementation that addresses the following network configuration problem is described. Telecommunication network managers at the Dutch PTT are regularly asked to install new connections between a group of users and a specific application. Several pieces of equipment have to be assembled. Choosing the specific pieces and types of equipment depends on many factors, and these choices are difficult because of the large number of constraints and the different kinds of equipment available. A distributed approach was chosen because of the problem domain's inherently distributed character, and a blackboard architecture because of its suitability for distributed AI systems, planning problems, and incremental system development. The system was implemented in the distributed blackboard environment, Blondie-III, as part of a larger project researching distributed AI. The problem is described in some detail, the reasons for using a distributed blackboard system to solve it are discussed, and the implementation and its evaluation are presented. The system's most striking feature is not the distribution of the problem-solving process, but the way search is conducted on the blackboard, as well as the natural integration of several types of knowledge (including rule-based and procedural knowledge).>	,Application software;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Filling;Humans;Modems;Multiplexing;Problem-solving;Telecommunication computing,expert systems;telecommunication network management;telecommunications computingAI;Blondie-III;distributed blackboard implementation;expert systems;incremental system development;network configuration;planning problems;procedural knowledge;rule-based

1968	Low-temperature reaction of thin-film platinum (?300 �) with (100) silicon	Tsui, Bing-Yue; Chen, Mao-Chieh	Journal of Applied Physics	20090707	Thin platinum films of 164 and 303 � thickness are deposited on (100) silicon and annealed at temperatures ranging from 180 to 300 �C in a nitrogen furnace for various times ranging from 1 min to 200 h. Sheet resistance (Rs ) measurement shows a four-stage silicide formation sequence: (1) the Rs increases to a maximum value; (2) the Rs then decreases to a minimum value; (3) the Rs increases once again and reaches a second maximum value; and (4) the Rs decreases to a final stable value. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the initial phase grown is Pt12Si5 which corresponds to the sheet-resistance increase in the first stage. This phase is also identified by the transmission electron diffraction analysis. This is the first time that the Pt12Si5 phase formed by the Pt/Si direct reaction is observed. The second stage corresponds to the growth of Pt2Si as confirmed by the x-ray diffraction and Auger spectroscopy analyses. The third stage corresponds to the growth of PtSi and the final stage corresponds to the increase of PtSi grain size. Samples with initial Pt films of 500, 800, and 2000 � thickness were also prepared and analyzed by x-ray diffraction. The increase of film thickness suppresses the growth of Pt12Si5, and for Pt films thicker than 800 � the initial phase grown becomes Pt2Si. The film thickness dependence is explained by the partial lattice-match-induced preferred phase growth effect. The effective absorption coefficient (Kse ) of the Pt/Si structure after annealing is determined by ellipsometry measurement, and the activation energy of the Pt12Si5 phase formation derived from the Rs -time plot or the Kse -time plot is determined to be 1.5�1.6 e- V.

1977	Toward AI research methodology: three case studies in evaluation	Cohen, P.R.; Howe, A.E.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The roles of evaluation in empirical artificial intelligence (AI) research are described, in an idealized cyclic model and in the context of three case studies. The case studies illustrate the pitfalls in evaluation and the contributions of evaluation at all stages of the research cycle. Evaluation methods are contrasted with those of the behavioral sciences, and it is concluded that AI must define and refine its own methods. To this end, several experiment schemas and many specific evaluation criteria are described. Recommendations are offered in the hope of encouraging the development and practice of evaluation methods in AI. The first case study illustrates problems with evaluating knowledge-based systems, specifically a portfolio management expert system called FOLIO.

For constant-speed operation the system equations are reduced to a set of linear differential equations with constant coefficients which are solved to predict drive waveforms, allowing for inverter DC-voltage waveform, DC-link-current ripple and the changing states of conduction of the rotor rectifier diodes. Eigenvalue and eigenvector techniques are applied to obtain analytical expressions which greatly reduce computation time. The harmonic content of the various current waveforms is examined, and the analysis used to examine certain features of drive performance such as stator-current pulsations at certain speeds.

The results were compared with theory and other work. The TiSi2 films were formed by Ti/Si solid-state interaction on crystalline silicon or polysilicon substrates. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of TiSi2 was approximated by the BlochﾖGruneisen theory. The Hall-effect data show a multicarrier conduction mechanism in TiSi2. At low temperatures the Hall coefficient is positive for both substrates, but is negative at room temperature. The temperature at which the change of sign occurs is approximately 180 K for the crystalline-Si substrate, and approximately 90 K for the polysilicon substrate. This is discussed briefly in terms of scattering mechansims for a simple model of the electronic structure.

Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The theoretical classification performance of a Hopfield neural network is presented. An important link between empirically based investigations of neural network classification models and the correct application of these models to AI-based systems is established. General expressions are derived relating the performance of the Hopfield model to the number and dimensionality of code vectors stored in memory. The average performance of the network is analyzed by randomizing the subsequent code vectors and examining classification relative to the output bit errors. An exact probabilistic description of the network is derived for the first iteration, and an approximate second-moment analysis generalizable to multiple iterations examines performance near a fixed point. Degradations generated by noisy or incomplete input data are analyzed. The results show that the Hopfield net has major limitations when applied to fixed pattern classification problems because of its sensitivity to the number of code vectors stored in memory and the signal-to-noise ratio of the input data	,Associative memory;Hopfield neural networks;Laser radar;Neural networks;Nonlinear optics;Optical feedback;Optical sensors;Pattern classification;Performance analysis;Speech recognition,information theory;iterative methods;learning systems;neural netsAI-based systems;Hebbian-like learning rule;Hopfield neural network;approximate second-moment analysis;code vectors;degradation;exact probabilistic description;fixed pattern classification problems;iteration;signal-to-noise ratio;theoretical classification performance

This allows problem-domain issues to be readily captured and expressed at several levels of granularity. Conceptual graph (CG) propositions can also act as a flexible intermediate form for the more common representations used in implementing many AI systems-frames, production rules, conceptual dependency, and logic systems. Thus, CG knowledge models are capable of symbolic translation into forms that are more familiar.

1991	Viewing knowledge bases as qualitative models	Clancey, W.J.	IEEE Expert	20020806	A viewpoint on expert systems is developed that considers the qualitative nature of knowledge encoded in such programs. It is maintained that all knowledge bases contain models of systems in the world. Reasoning involves sequences of tasks (for example, monitoring and diagnosis) by which an understanding or model of specific situations is related to action plans. Programs use a simple repertoire of qualitative modeling techniques commonly called knowledge representations. The situation-specific-model concept makes concrete exactly what programs know and how to describe problem solving in terms of model-manipulation operators. The viewpoint is exemplified for the particular case of medical diagnosis. A historical perspective shows how AI's concern with adaptiveness and the rationality of the autonomous agent emphasizes the role of models as what a problem-solver knows. It is suggested that this has been to the detriment of understanding the primary characteristic of knowledge in terms of models that partition the world, viewing it selectively and making it coherent for some purpose.>	,Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Circuit simulation;Diagnostic expert systems;Electronic circuits;Expert systems;Knowledge representation;Mathematical model;Prototypes;Writing,expert systems;medical diagnostic computingartificial intelligence;diagnosis;expert systems;knowledge bases;knowledge representations;medical diagnosis;monitoring;qualitative models;reasoning;sequences of tasks

1993	A multi-rate transcoder	Lovrich, A.; Reimer, J.	Consumer Electronics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The authors describe a single-chip, half-duplex multirate transcoder device. The device is pin selectable as a 32-kb/s ADPCM (adaptive differential pulse code modulation) transcoder and a 16-kb/s subband coding transcoder, and it provides a 64-kb/s PCM passthrough option. The transcoder implementation is fully compatible with the 32-kb/s ADPCM standard defined by ANSI and CCITT recommendation G.721 bis. The subband coder (SBC) algorithm provides a high-quality, cost-effective medium bit-rate solution. The ADPCM and SBC implementations on the device produce toll quality speech	,ANSI standards;Artificial intelligence;Bandwidth;Bit rate;Channel capacity;Codecs;Costs;Phase change materials;Pulse modulation;Transcoding,decoding;encoding;pulse-code modulation;standards;vocoders16 kbit/s;32 kbit/s;64 kbit/s;ADPCM standard;ANSI;CCITT recommendation G.721 bis;PCM passthrough option;adaptive differential pulse code modulation;cost-effective medium bit-rate solution;half-duplex multirate transcoder device;pin selectable;single-chip;subband coding transcoder;toll quality speech;vocoders							
1994	Future ATC automation aids based upon AI technology	Scardina, J.A.; Ryberg, P.-Y.; Gerstenfeld, A.	Proceedings of the IEEE	20020806	The authors discuss two knowledge-based systems that are currently under development by the US Federal Aviation Administration, namely a simulation system for air traffic controller training and an automated problem resolution capability that is the central feature of the Automated En Route Air Traffic Control System (AERA 2). For each of these systems, the manner in which knowledge-based system technology is applied is discussed, along with the knowledge bases. The process for building, refining, and evaluating the knowledge bases is also presented. In the air traffic controller training system, ATCoach, the representation of ATC knowledge has been shown to be highly beneficial for both ATC training and airspace modeling. In AERA 2 automated problem resolution (APR) evaluations, the AI/knowledge-based system technology has proven to be indispensable in the representation of the experts' knowledge and the effective factoring of the knowledge into APR. It is concluded that these applications offer great potential for success and, consequently, represent only the first step in applying AI principles to ATC	,Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Air traffic control;Artificial intelligence;Automatic control;Automation;Data processing;Expert systems;FAA;Paper technology;Radar,aerospace simulation;air traffic computer control;computer aided instruction;digital simulation;knowledge based systems;trainingAERA 2;AI technology;ATC training;ATCoach;Automated En Route Air Traffic Control System;US Federal Aviation Administration;automated problem resolution capability;knowledge representation;knowledge-based systems

1996	Artificial intelligence dialects of the Bayesian belief revision language	Schocken, S.; Kleindorfer, P.R.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Several well-known belief languages in artificial intelligence are reviewed, and both previous work and new insights into their Bayesian interpretations are presented. In particular, the authors focus on three alternative belief-update models: the certainty factors calculus, Dempster-Shafer simple support functions, and the descriptive contrast/inertia model. Important `dialects' of these languages are shown to be isomorphic to each other and to a special case of Bayesian inference. Parts of the analysis were carried out by other authors; their results were extended and consolidated using an analytic technique designed to study the kinship of belief languages in general	,Application software;Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Calculus;Diagnostic expert systems;Expert systems;Geology;Psychology;Recruitment;Uncertainty,Bayes methods;artificial intelligenceAI dialects;Bayesian belief revision language;Bayesian inference;Dempster-Shafer simple support functions;artificial intelligence;belief-update models;certainty factors calculus;descriptive contrast/inertia model							
1997	A survey on the design of multiprocessing systems for artificial intelligence applications	Wah, B.; Li, G.J.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	Some issues in designing computers for artificial intelligence (AI) processing are discussed. These issues are divided into three levels: the representation level, the control level, and the processor level. The representation level deals with the knowledge and methods used to solve the problem and the means to represent it. The control level is concerned with the detection of dependencies and parallelism in the algorithmic and program representations of the problem, and with the synchronization and scheduling of concurrent tasks. The processor level addresses the hardware and architectural components needed to evaluate the algorithmic and program representations. Solutions for the problems of each level are illustrated by a number of representative systems. Design decisions in existing projects on AI computers are classed into top-down, bottom-up, and middle-out approaches	,Aerodynamics;Application software;Artificial intelligence;Data structures;Distributed processing;Hardware;Multiprocessing systems;Parallel processing;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm,multiprocessing systems;parallel programmingAI computers;artificial intelligence applications;control level;dependencies;multiprocessing systems;parallelism;processor level;program representations;representation level							
1998	Blackboard system generator (BSG): an alternative distributed problem-solving paradigm	Silverman, Barry G.; Chang, J.S.; Feggos, K.	Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on	20020806	The authors review the status of a generic blackboard-based distributed problem-solving environment in which multiple agent cooperation can be effected. This environment is organized into a shared information panel, a chairman control panel, and a metaplanning panel. Each panel, in turn, contains a number of embedded AI (artificial-intelligence) techniques that facilitate its operation and that provide heuristics for solving the underlying team-agent decision problem. The status of these panels and heuristics is described along with a number of robustness considerations. The techniques of each of the three panels and of four sets of paradigm-related advances are described, along with selected results from classroom teaching experiments and from three applications using BSG to date	,Adaptive control;Artificial intelligence;Control systems;Decision theory;Expert systems;Meeting planning;NASA;Problem-solving;Project management;Scheduling,artificial intelligence;problem solvingAI;artificial-intelligence;blackboard system generator;chairman control panel;distributed problem-solving;heuristics;metaplanning panel;multiple agent cooperation;team-agent decision problem
